# Data Types


## Question 1. 
The two variables, `first_number` and `second_number`, are given as follows:
```{python, echo = T, eval = F}
first_number = 4
second_number = 8
```

Modify the following line by putting parenthesis around the two variables added:

```{python, echo = T, eval = F}
average = first_number + second_number / 2
```

After modifying the above line, write a Python code that uses (1) the `print()` function and (2) the variables, `first_number`, `second_number`, and `average` to print out the following in the Spyder Console:


<div style="font-family:courier">The average of 4 and 8 is 6.0</div>

<br>

**Answers**:
```{python, echo = T, eval = F}
average = (first_number + second_number) / 2
print("The average of", first_number, "and", second_number, "is", average)
```

<br><br>


## Question 2.
The variables, `string` and `second_number`, are given as follows:
```{python, echo = T, eval = F}
string_length = "length of string"
```

Write a Python code to count the length of `string_length`.

<br>

**Answers**:
```{python, echo = T, eval = F}
len(string_length)
```

<br><br><br>

# Data Structures

## Question 3.

The variable `list_variable` is given:
```{python, echo = T, eval = F}
list_variable = [7, True, 3, "Hello", 1.5]
```

Write a Python code to change the value `True` to value `False` in `list_variable`.

<br>

**Answers**:
```{python, echo = T, eval = F}
list_variable[1] = False
```

<br><br>



## Question 4.

- Construct a dictionary with the keyword-value pairs: `alpha` and 1.0, `beta` and 3.141592, `gamma` and -100. 

- How can the value of `alpha` be retrieved from the dictionary?

<br>

**Answers**:
```{python, echo = T, eval = F}
abc = dict(alpha = 1.0, beta = 3.141592, gamma = -100)
abc['alpha']
```

# `if`-conditionals


## Question 5.

Write a Python code that determines a personâ€™s stage of life. Set a value for the variable `age`, and then:

  - If the person is less than 2 years old, print a message that <div style="font-family:courier">The person is a baby!</div>
  - If the person is at least 2 years old but less than 4, print a message that <div style="font-family:courier">The person is a toddler!</div>
  - If the person is at least 4 years old but less than 13, print a message that <div style="font-family:courier">The person is an kid!</div>
  - If the person is at least 13 years old but less than 20, print a message that <div style="font-family:courier">The person is a teenager!</div>
  - If the person is at least 20 years old but less than 65, print a message that <div style="font-family:courier">The person is an adult!</div>
  - If the person is age 65 or older, print a message that <div style="font-family:courier">The person is an elder!</div>

<br>

**Answers**:
```{python, echo = T, eval = F}
age = 36

if age < 2:
    print("The person is a baby!")
elif age < 4:
    print("The person is a toddler!")
elif age < 13:
    print("The person is a kid!")
elif age < 20:
    print("The person is a teenager!")
elif age < 65:
    print("The person is an adult!")
else:
    print("The person is an elder!")
```

<br><br><br>



# `while`-loops

## Question 6.

- Assign the value 7 to the variable `guess_me`, and the value 1 to the variable `number`. 

- Write a `while`-loop that compares `number` with `guess_me`. 
  - Print 'too low' if `number` is less than `guess_me`. 
  - If `number` equals `guess_me`, print 'found it!' and then exit the loop. 
  - If `number` is greater than `guess_me`, print 'oops' and then exit the loop.
  - Increment `number` at the end of the loop.

<br>

**Answers**:
```{python, echo = T, eval = F}
guess_me = 7
number = 1

while True:
    if number < guess_me:
        print('too low')
    elif number == guess_me:
        print('found it!')
        break
    elif number > guess_me:
        print('oops')
        break
    number += 1
```

<br><br>



# `for`-loops

## Question 7.

- Assign a list of the integer numbers from 1 to 9 in `numbers`

- After creating the list `numbers`, write a Python code that uses (1) for loop that processes each element in the list `numbers` and (2) `if`-`elif`-`else` statement inside the loop to print the proper ordinal ending for each number. 

- The output should read "1st 2nd 3rd 4th 5th 6th 7th 8th 9th", and each result should be on a separate line.

<br>

**Answers**:
```{python, echo = T, eval = F}
numbers = list(range(1,10))

for number in numbers:
    if number == 1:
        print(str(number) + "st")
    elif number == 2:
        print(str(number) + "nd")
    elif number == 3:
        print(str(number) + "rd")
    else:
        print(str(number) + "th")

```

<br><br><br>





# `try`-`except` statement

## Question 8.

Write a Python code that uses the `input()` function with a message in the Console "Please enter a number: " to print out 

<div style="font-family:courier">The number you entered is: NUMBER_ENTERED</div> 

<br>

if the number entered, NUMBER_ENTERED, in the Console is a number and 

<br>

<div style="font-family:courier">The value you entered is not a number.</div> 

<br>

if the number entered is not a number.


<br>

**Answers**:
```{python, echo = T, eval = F}
try:
    value_entered = int(input("Please enter a number: "))
    print("The number you entered is:", str(value_entered))
except ValueError:
    print("The value you entered is not a number.")
```

<br><br><br>





# Functions

## Question 9.

Define a function called `harrypotter()` that returns the following list: `['Harry', 'Ron', 'Hermione']`.

<br>

**Answers**:
```{python, echo = T, eval = F}
def harrypotter():
    return ['Harry', 'Ron', 'Hermione']

harrypotter()
```
