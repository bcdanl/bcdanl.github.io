# Question 1

## Q1a

Read the data file, `bikeshare_cleaned.csv`, as the data.frame object with the name, `bikeshare`, using (1) the `read_csv()` function and (2) its URL, `https://bcdanl.github.io/data/bikeshare_cleaned.csv`.

```{r}

```

Use the data.frame `bikeshare` for the rest of questions in Question 1.

### Description of variables in the data file, `bikeshare_cleaned.csv`

The data set, `bikeshare_cleaned.csv`, includes 17376 observations of hourly counts from 2011 to 2012 for bike rides (rentals) in Washington D.C.

-   `cnt`: count of total bikes rented out
-   `year`: year
-   `month`: month
-   `date`: date
-   `hr`: hours
-   `wkday`: week day
-   `holiday`: holiday if holiday == 1; non-holiday otherwise
-   `seasons`: season
-   `weather_cond`: weather condition
-   `temp`: temperature, measured in standard deviations from average.
-   `hum`: humidity, measured in standard deviations from average.
-   `windspeed`: wind speed, measured in standard deviations from average.

# Question 2

## Q2a

Read the data file, `NY_school_enrollment_socioecon.csv`, as the data.frame object with the name, `NY_school_enrollment_socioecon`, using (1) the `read_csv()` function and (2) its URL, `https://bcdanl.github.io/data/NY_school_enrollment_socioecon.csv`.

```{r}

```

For description of variables in `NY_school_enrollment_socioecon`, refer to the file, `ny_school_enrollment_socioecon_description.zip`, which is in the Files section in our Canvas web-page. (I recommend you to extract the zip file, and then read the file, `ny_school_enrollment_socioecon_description.csv`, using Excel or Numbers.)



- Here are some details about the data.frame, `NY_school_enrollment_socioecon`:

- The geographic and time units of observation (row) in the data.frame, `NY_school_enrollment_socioecon`, are *New York county* and *year*.

```{r, echo=F, eval=T}
text_tbl <- data.frame(
  FIPS = c(36001),
  year = c(2015),
  county_name = c("Albany"),
  pincp = c(55793),
  c01_001 = c(84463),
  c02_002 = c(4.7)
  )

kbl(text_tbl) %>%
  kable_paper(full_width = F) %>%
  column_spec(1, bold = T) %>%
  column_spec(2, bold = T) %>%
  column_spec(3, bold = T) %>%
  kable_paper("hover", full_width = F)

```

- For example, the observation above means that in Albany county in year 2015 ...
  - Average personal income of people is $55,793.
  - Population 3 years and over enrolled in school is 84,463.
  - Percent of population 3 years and over enrolled in nursery school and preschool is 4.7%.
  


- The following is sample observations from Bronx and Livingston counties:

```{r, echo=FALSE, out.width = '100%', fig.align='center'}
knitr::include_graphics("lec_figs/danl200-hw1-sample-data.png")
```

- The following describes the variables:

  - `c01_010`:  *Total!!Population enrolled in college or graduate school*
  - So, `c01_010` is total population enrolled in college or graduate school;
  
  - `c02_010`:  *Percent!!Population enrolled in college or graduate school*
  - So, `c02_010` is a *percent* of total population enrolled in college or graduate school;
  
  - In which county is more likely for a person to be enrolled in a college or graduate school? 
  


-  A county's college enrollment level can be represented by an *overall* tendency of that county's residents to be enrolled in college (as long as we are interested in analyzing how human behaves overall).


- The size of a county's population enrolled in college or graduate school (`c01_010`) may *not* be appropriate to represent a county's college enrollment level. 

  - A county's larger size of population enrolled in college does not necessarily mean people in people in that county are likely to be enrolled in college.

- Consider the following example:

```{r, echo=F, eval=T}
text_tbl <- data.frame(
  `County` = c("A", "B"),
  `Total Population` = c("100,000", "1,000"),
  `Bachelor's Degree` = c("1,000", "999"),
  `High School` = c("99,000", "1"),
  `Percent of Bachelor's Degree` = c("1.0%", "99.9%"),
  `Percent of High School` = c("99.0%", "0.1%")
  )
kbl(text_tbl) %>%
  kable_paper(full_width = F) %>%
  column_spec(1, bold = T) %>%
  kable_paper("hover", full_width = F)
```

  - Although County A has the larger number of people that have bachelor's degrees than County B, it is more appropriate to say that people in County B have a higher college enrollment than people in County A.
  
  - This is because the overall tendency of County B's people to attend college is stronger than that of County A's people.

- Similarly, to represent a standard of living of people in a country, we do not use a country's gross domestic product (*GDP*) but its *GDP per capita* (GDP per capita is GDP devided by population).

  - For example, China records the second largest GDP in the world as of now. However, World Bank still considers China a middle-income country, because of its relatively low level of GDP per capita.
