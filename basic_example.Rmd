This is a paragraph in an R Markdown document.

Below is a code chunk:

```{r}
library(tidyverse)

fit <- lm(dist ~ speed, data = cars)
b <- coef(fit)

ggplot(cars) +
  geom_smooth( aes( x = speed, 
                    y = dist ),
               method = lm)

```

The slope of the regression is `r b[1]`.
