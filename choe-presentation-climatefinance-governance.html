# Governance and Climate Finance in the Developing World
----
## ** **
### Byeong-Hak Choe and Tilsa Ore Monago
### July 25, 2023




---
# Introduction

Climate finance mainly refers to transnational financing that rich countries provide poor countries with financial resources, in order to help them **adapt** to climate change and **mitigate** greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions.

- To feasibly reach the goal of net zero by 2050, international climate finance must increase by a factor of six by 2030.

- This requires that finance is effectively used to secure decarbonization and a just transition. 


---
# Motivation

Mitigation projects tend to target the **energy sector**, and  being this a sector characterized by important sunk costs and long-term high rents.

--

Energy related projects within countries with poor **governance** can be subject to increasing asymmetric information problems. 
  - This may include moral hazard from contract parties by renegotiations or increased corruption.
  - These issues are relevant for **climate finance effectiveness**

--

It is crucial to assess the effectiveness of climate finance in the developing world.
  - Developing countries are the most vulnerable to climate change, and subject to poor governance. 
  


---
# Motivation
### &lt;p style="color:#00449E"&gt; Why it matters? &lt;/p&gt;


Poor governance can be significant barriers to emissions reductions within these countries. 
  
  
We conduct a study to characterize climate finance, particularly those that flows from developed to developing countries, and then to identify problems and quantify potential hindrances to the effectiveness of climate finance.

# Climate Change and Sustainability Goals

# Climate Change and Sustainability Goals
### &lt;p style="color:#00449E"&gt;  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;!-- Climate change affects humanity and the ecosystem in several ways. --&gt;
&lt;!--   - Extreme weather events --&gt;
&lt;!--   - Sea level rises --&gt;
&lt;!--   - Drought and water stress --&gt;

&lt;!-- -- --&gt;

Greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions have been consistently increasing decade by decade. 
  - Global GHG emissions grew by 25.4% between 2000 and 2010 and 11% between 2010 and 2019; 
  - Increases are explained mainly by upper-middle income countries.

--

Emissions no longer primarily OECD / US problem.
  - Most important emitter now China +.
  - Principal emissions growth now India and developing world.
  - If non-OECD countries don’t clean up their acts, too, the world will emit a lot more GHGs sooner than later.

# Climate Change and Sustainability Goals

.pull-right[


The top four economic sectors that jointly explain 57% of global high GHG emissions are:
  - Electricity and heat
  - Transport
  - Manufacturing and construction
  - Agriculture

# Climate Change and Sustainability Goals
### &lt;p style="color:#00449E"&gt;  &lt;/p&gt;


&lt;img src="lec_figs/IncomeGroupESector.png" width="95%" /&gt;




&lt;!-- Low and lower-middle income countries' share of GHG emissions by sector will be similar to high-income countries' one.  --&gt;




---
# Climate Change and Sustainability Goals
### &lt;p style="color:#00449E"&gt;  &lt;/p&gt;

It is urgent to reduce emissions by accelerating the economies' decarbonization via mitigation actions.


In December 2015, the Paris Agreement set the ambitious target of limiting global temperature rise to 1.5°C or, at most, 2°C by 2050. 
  - Parties agreed to submit their national climate action plan to their reduce GHG emissions and actions to adapt to climate change impacts. 
  - **Climate finance**: Developed countries parties committed to providing financial assistance to developing countries parties to mitigate GHG emissions and adapt to climate change.

# Climate Finance
&lt;html&gt;&lt;div style='float:left'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;hr color='#EB811B' size=1px width=796px&gt;&lt;/html&gt;


---
# Climate Finance
### &lt;p style="color:#00449E"&gt;  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;!-- Climate finance mainly refers to funds mobilized to climate change mitigation and adaptation activities around the world. --&gt;


In 2015,  developed countries confirmed their agreement to jointly invest US$ 100 billion per year from various sources in climate finance initiatives by 2020 and to continue this level of annual spending through 2025.

--

Between 2016 and 2020, developing countries received around US$ 66 billion in private climate finance.
  - 86% of these climate funds were given for mitigation projects.
  - 53% of those mitigation projects were energy related (mostly for renewable energy).

--

Current climate finance flows are very far from being sufficient given the net zero goals.


---
# Climate Finance
### &lt;p style="color:#00449E"&gt; Type of financing &lt;/p&gt;

Funds can be provided by the public sector, private sector or by the combination of both

--

Funds can come from direct national and sub-national governments, private financial institutions, philanthropy foundations, multilateral institutions or development banks.

--

There is also climate-specific funding mechanisms---UNFCCC funds, non-UNFCCC funds and national climate funds.
  - Global Environment Facility (GEF)
  - Green Climate Fund (GCF)
  - Adaptation Fund (AF)
  - Climate Investment Funds (CIF)


---
# Climate Finance
### &lt;p style="color:#00449E"&gt; Type of financing &lt;/p&gt;

Climate finance is given through 
  - Grants, 
  - Debt through loans (including concessional or soft loans)
  - Equity
  - Guarantees. 


Incentives for donor/recipient countries may vary according to the financial instrument. 



---
# Access to Climate Finance
### &lt;p style="color:#00449E"&gt;  &lt;/p&gt;

Access to climate finance has been challenging particularly for Least Developed Countries (LDCs) and Small Island Developing States (SIDS). 
  - There is a lack of clarity between development finance and climate finance for adaptation actions
  - Climate finance would often be linked to donors' interest and policy goals.


--

Recipient country's economic conditions and regulatory environments are crucial, as well as institutional capacity and maturity.
  - These factors are highly related to country's governance.
  - Nest et. al. (2020) poses corruption as a crucial governance issue that may undermine the climate-related achievements. 

&lt;!-- This would be related to high requirements that LDCs and SIDS may not be able to comply.  --&gt;

&lt;!-- In fact, some process requirements were identified as access barriers, for example the requirement of historical weather data for last 30 years to support climate change-related rationale has posed challenging to the recipient countries as most of them lack of such data.  --&gt;

&lt;!-- Another identified obstacle or barrier is the lack of standardization of requirements and processes to access to climate finance across finance sources.  --&gt;

&lt;!-- There is also a lack of clarity between development finance and climate finance for adaptation actions, which adds confusion and inefficiencies in the process and in the funds allocation. --&gt;

&lt;!-- Finally, one aspect highlighted in their analysis is that bilateral channels tend to be less transparent and more discretionary.  --&gt;

&lt;!-- Since most of the climate finance flows to these countries are given by bilateral channels, recipients perceive that finance would often be linked to donors' interest and policy goals.\\ --&gt;

# Stylized Facts about Climate Finance
### &lt;p style="color:#00449E"&gt; Global climate finance flow &lt;/p&gt;


- Public sector finance accounted for more than half (51%) of climate finance during the period 2019-2020. 
  - Roughly 37% of total public finance was given by national development financial institutions (DFIs)
  - Around 20% of it came from multilateral DFIs.


---
# Stylized Facts about Climate Finance
### &lt;p style="color:#00449E"&gt; Global climate finance flow &lt;/p&gt;

- Private sector contributed with 49% of the annual climate finance.
  - Corporations contributed with 40% of the total private finance.
  - Commercial banks accounted 39% of the private finance, mostly for clean energy projects.


- Global climate finance was given through
  - Loans (61%), Equity investments (33%). 
  - Grants (6%), from which 55% correspond to international flows. 
  - Around 90% of the global climate finance went to **mitigation** projects.


- Geographically, global climate finance is concentrated in East Asia and Pacific (43%), Western Europe (20%), and US \&amp; Canada (20%).
  
  

---
# Stylized Facts about Climate Finance
### &lt;p style="color:#00449E"&gt; Flows from developed to developing countries &lt;/p&gt;

The commitment, made with the Paris agreement, of jointly mobilize USD 100 billion per year in climate finance by 2020 was not fully met.

- Most of climate-specific finance flow from developed to developing countries (79%) were provided by bilateral, regional and other channels. 

- The rest 21% was given by multilateral DFIs and multilateral climate funds.




---
# Stylized Facts about Climate Finance
### &lt;p style="color:#00449E"&gt; Flows from developed to developing countries &lt;/p&gt;
There is no clear estimate of private climate finance to developing countries. 

- The total private climate finance mobilized by multilateral funds to developing countries may amounted USD 66.8 billion.
  - 86% of which was provided for **mitigation projects**, half of this to specifically fund the **energy sector**. 
 
  
- Private climate finance for adaptation targeted projects for industry, mining and construction. 
  



---
# Stylized Facts about Climate Finance
### &lt;p style="color:#00449E"&gt; Flows from developed to developing countries &lt;/p&gt;

- A large share of climate finance flows are directed to **mitigation projects**. 
  - 57% of funds from bilateral channels were for mitigation activities, only 28% for adaptation projects. 


- More than 90% of multilateral finance are given to **adaptation**, **cross-cutting** and other general projects.

- Public finance for mitigation projects were mostly given by loans, while public finance for adaptation projects was predominantly given by grants.



---
# Stylized Facts about Climate Finance
### &lt;p style="color:#00449E"&gt; Flows from developed to developing countries &lt;/p&gt;

Most of the climate finance for developing countries were provided to Asia (36%), followed by Africa (27%) and then Latin America (16%).

- Out of the USD 13.6 billion committed finance for climate-related projects from the GCF, only USD 5.1 billion (37.5%) was disbursed.



---
# Stylized Facts about Climate Finance
### &lt;p style="color:#00449E"&gt; Public climate finance flows to developing countries by channel, area of support and type of instrument &lt;/p&gt;


&lt;img src="lec_figs/cf_flow.png" width="100%" /&gt;






---
# Climate Finance and Foreign Aid
### &lt;p style="color:#00449E"&gt;  &lt;/p&gt;

Financing economic development projects has been provided to developing countries under the figure of foreign aid that has been defined as official development assistance (ODA) by the OECD's Development Assistant Committee.
  - Donor countries are basically OECD country members.
  - ODA recipients are developing countries including upper-middle income countries.

--

Climate finance has been widely allocated to the developing world through ODA means.


Likewise, climate finance to developing countries and aid are both mostly given by bilateral channels (approximately 89%).
  


---
# Climate Finance and Foreign Aid
### &lt;p style="color:#00449E"&gt;  &lt;/p&gt;

Foreign aid has not been very successful in bridging the investment gap in poor countries – nor has it led to increasing growth rates. 
  - The empirical evidence suggests that aid increases consumption rather than investment.


- Political variables in recipient countries explain aid misuse. 
  - Aid would enrich corrupt elites, and incentivize corruption and violence.
  - Aid was not necessarily directed towards countries in greater need, due to strategic or political interests that influence donor’s incentive to allocate aid.
  



---
# Climate Finance, Foreign Aid, and Incentives
### &lt;p style="color:#00449E"&gt;  &lt;/p&gt;

Donors should allocate more funds to less corrupt countries.
- But as long as funds allocation is discretionary, donors cannot systematically allocate finance or aid to less corrupt countries.

--

It might be possible to limit the scope of corruption. 
  - Increasing enforcement and post-evaluations of financed projects or aid’s uses might be powerful tools for that purpose. 
  - There is a lack of evaluation of funds usage in climate finance.

--

Governance factors such as perceived corruption, lack of rule of law (or low level of private property protection) lack of political stability (less predictability) may affect climate finance allocation.

---
# Energy-related Projects
### &lt;p style="color:#00449E"&gt;  &lt;/p&gt;

Clean energies are being implemented in several countries, but the deployment of such projects face important barriers in emerging economies. 



Solar and wind projects require high upfront costs and low operating costs.
  - Investors face significant capital investment, which might be recoverable under secured demand and stable economy.


---
# Energy-related Projects
### &lt;p style="color:#00449E"&gt; Barriers to mobilize required finance &lt;/p&gt;

1. Limited affordability or limited fiscal flexibility of governments to incur in clean energy public investment


2. Limited access to private capital and the high capital cost.
  - These are associated to weak or underdeveloped financial markets, poor or weak policy and regulatory frameworks, and lack of adequate institutional capacity.


3. Societal pressures to keep subsidies for the use of fossil fuel.
  - Transport and cooking fuels are then more affordable for the mass population.

---
# Data
### &lt;p style="color:#00449E"&gt; Global climate finance &lt;/p&gt;


The following data on global climate finance at sector level is collected from UNFCCC Climate Finance Data Portal and Global Environmental Facility:

- Donor country/funds
- Recipient country
- Contribution (funding size in USD)
- Funding status (disbursed/provided vs. committed)
- Funding source (ODA or not)
- Financial instrument (grant vs. non-grant)
- Project characteristics
  - Sector (Energy, Transport, Agriculture, and so on)
  - Type of support (adaptation vs. mitigation vs. cross-cutting)
  - Additional details


---
# Data
### &lt;p style="color:#00449E"&gt; Governance &lt;/p&gt;

The following governance data at country level are colleceted from the World Bank Governance Indicators:

- Government effectiveness
- Voice and accountability
- Political stability and absence of violence/terrorism
- Regulatory quality
- Rule of law
- Control of corruption .



---
# Data
### &lt;p style="color:#00449E"&gt; Governance &lt;/p&gt;

The PRS Group's governance data are also collected, and they provides political risks, economic risks, and financial risks based on the assessment of the political/economic/financial stability. For example:
  - Government instability
  - Asset expropriation
  - Transfer/payment delays
  - Cross-border conflict
  - Internal conflict
  - Terrorism
  - Corruption


---
# Data
### &lt;p style="color:#00449E"&gt; Controls &lt;/p&gt;

In order to control for other determinants of climate funding decisions, we collect data for various variables related to climate finance and climate change projects from the IMF, the World Bank, and the UN FAO, and Climate Watch.

- Bilateral trade pattern of low carbon technology products. For example,
  - Wind turbines, solar panels, biomass systems, and carbon capture equipment.
- Energy intensity (MJ/GDP)
  - The quantity of energy utilized to generate a specific output or activity level. 
  
  

---
# Data
### &lt;p style="color:#00449E"&gt; Controls &lt;/p&gt;

- Various economic indicators:
  - Electricity generation capacity from renewable energy sources
  - Access to electricity
  - Access to basic drinking water
  - Energy depletion, natural resources depletion, natural resources rents, and fuel trades,
  - Greenhouse gas emissions from various sectors.

# Empirical analysis
### &lt;p style="color:#00449E"&gt;  &lt;/p&gt;

The following regression methods are employed:
  - Random forests
  - OLS
  - LASSO


Random forests allow for the measurement of the relative importance of each independent variable in predicting the dependent variable (**Variable importance**). 


LASSO regression performs variable selection by including a small subset of the available variables that are relevant to predicting the outcome of interest.


OLS is used for the base line.

# Conclusion
### &lt;p style="color:#00449E"&gt;  &lt;/p&gt;

To establish causality, I plan to adopt the following methods:
  - Propensity score methods
  - Causal inference with machine learning (ML)
    - Double ML, Generalized random forests, etc.


- Which variables should be used for the treatment effects?
- What would be the source of heterogeneity in the treatment effect?
