## Question 1.
base-R provides the R object `state.name`. Write an R code to assign `state.name` to a variable, `US_states`.

*Answer*:
```{r}

```

<br><br>

## Question 2.
The `temp_F` vector contains the average high temperatures in January for the following cities: Seoul, Lagos, Paris, Rio de Janeiro, San Juan, and Rochester.

```{r}
temp_F <- c(35, 88, 42, 84, 81, 30)
```

Create a new vector named `temp_C` that stores the converted Celsius temperatures. Below is the conversion formula:

$$
C = \frac{5}{9}\times(F - 32)
$$

*Answer*:
```{r}

```

<br><br>


## Question 3.
- Write an R code to calculate the standard deviation (SD) of the integer vector `x` below manually. That is to calculate the SD without using the `sd()` function.

```{r}
x <- 1:25
```

- Also, write an R code to test whether the standard deviation you calculate manually above is equal to `sd(x)`.



*Answer*:
```{r}


```

<br><br>



## Question 4.
- Consider the vectors:

```{r}
my_vec <- c(-10, -20, 30, 10, 50, 40, -100)
beers <- c("BUD LIGHT", "BUSCH LIGHT", "COORS LIGHT", 
           "GENESEE LIGHT", "MILLER LITE", "NATURAL LIGHT")
```


- Write an R code to filter only the positive values in `my_vec`.
- Write an R code to access the beers that are in positions 2, 4, and 6 using indexing.


<br><br>



## Question 5.
- Write an R code to read the CSV file, `https://bcdanl.github.io/data/mlb_teams.csv` using the `tidyverse`'s `read_csv()` function, and assign it to `MLB_teams`.

*Answer*:
```{r}

```

<br><br>





## Question 6.
Write an R code to provide summary statistics---mean, standard deviation, minimum, first quartile, median, third quartile, and maximum---for variables in the `MLB_teams` data.frame.

*Answer*:
```{r}

```
