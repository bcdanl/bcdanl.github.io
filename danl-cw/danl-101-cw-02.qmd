## Question 1.
- Write an R code to create a numeric vector named `numbers` containing the integers from 10 to 50.

*Answer*:
```{r}

```

<br><br>


## Question 2.
- Create a logical vector `logical_vec` that checks whether the elements of the vector `ages <- c(15, 22, 18, 24, 30)` are greater than or equal to 20.

```{r}
ages <- c(15, 22, 18, 24, 30)
```


*Answer*:
```{r}

```

<br><br>


## Question 3.
- Write an R code to assign the string "Hello, World!" to a variable named `greeting` and display its value on the Console.

*Answer*:
```{r}

```

<br><br>

## Question 4.
- Write an R code to calculate the range (difference between the maximum and minimum values) of the vector `temp <- c(22, 28, 31, 25, 29)`.

```{r}
temp <- c(22, 28, 31, 25, 29)
```


*Answer*:
```{r}

```

<br><br>


## Question 5.
- Write an R code to convert the character vector `char_vec <- c("1", "2", "3", "4")` into a numeric vector named `num_vec`.

```{r}
char_vec <- c("1", "2", "3", "4")
```

*Answer*:
```{r}

```


<br><br>

## Question 6.
- Write an R code to concatenate two character vectors, `first_names <- c("John", "Jane")` and `last_names <- c("Doe", "Smith")`, to create a vector `full_names` containing the full names using the `str_c()` function for vectorized string operations.

```{r}
first_names <- c("John", "Jane")
last_names <- c("Doe", "Smith")
```


*Answer*:
```{r}

```
