```{r}
#| include: false

library(nycflights13)
```


## Question 1
- Install the `nycflights13` R package and load it into your R session in your Posit Cloud project.

*Answer*:
```{r}
#| eval: false
# Install the nycflights13 package
install.packages("nycflights13")

# Load the package into your R session
library(nycflights13)
```

**Answer**:
In this step, we first install the `nycflights13` package using `install.packages()`, which contains datasets related to flights in and out of New York City in 2013. Once installed, we load the package into the R session with `library(nycflights13)`, making the `flights` and `airlines` data.frames available for analysis.

## Question 2
- The `nycflights13` package provides two data.frames: `flights` and `airlines`, which are related by the `carrier` variable.
  - `carrier`: A two-letter abbreviation indicating the full name of the airline.
  
- Use the `left_join()` function to create a new data.frame, `flight_airline`, that includes all observations and variables from the `flights` data.frame, along with the `name` variable from the `airlines` data.frame that corresponds to the `carrier` variable in the `flights` data.frame.

*Answer*:
```{r}
library(tidyverse)

# Perform left join to merge flights and airlines data.frames
flight_airline <- flights |> left_join(airlines)

# View the first few rows of the new data.frame
head(flight_airline)
```

**Answer**:
Here, we use the `left_join()` function from the one of the packages in `tidyverse`. The `left_join()` function merges two data.frames based on a common key variableâ€”in this case, the `carrier` variable, which is present in both the `flights` and `airlines` data.frames. This operation adds the `name` variable (airline name) from the `airlines` data.frame to the `flights` data.frame, while keeping all observations and variables from `flights`. The result is stored in `flight_airline`.
