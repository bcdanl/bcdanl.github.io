## Question 1
- Find all flights that had an arrival delay of two or more hours
- Find all flights that flew to Houston (`IAH` or `HOU`)
- Find all flights that departed in summer (July, August, and September)
- Find all flights that arrived more than two hours late, but didnâ€™t leave late
- Find all flights that departed between midnight and 6am (inclusive)

**Answer**:
```{r}
library(tidyverse)
flights <- nycflights13::flights

# Flights with arrival delay of 2 or more hours
delayed_flights <- flights |> filter(arr_delay >= 120)  # The unit of the `arr_delay` variable is in a minute.

# Flights to Houston (IAH or HOU)
houston_flights <- flights |> filter( dest == "IAH" | dest == "HOU" )

# Flights that departed in summer (July, August, September)
summer_flights <- flights |> filter( month == 7 | month == 8 | month == 9 )

# Flights that arrived more than two hours late but didnâ€™t leave late
late_arrival_on_time_departure <- flights |> filter( arr_delay > 120 & dep_delay <= 0 )

# Flights that departed between midnight and 6am (inclusive)
early_morning_flights <- flights |> filter( (dep_time >= 0 & dep_time <= 600) | dep_time == 2400 )
```


- `filter(arr_delay >= 120)`: Finds flights with an arrival delay of two or more hours.
- `filter( dest == "IAH" | dest == "HOU" )`: Filters flights flying to Houston by checking if the `dest` variable matches "IAH" or "HOU".
- `filter( month == 7 | month == 8 | month == 9 )`: Filters flights based on the `month` variable for July, August, and September.
- `filter(arr_delay > 120 & dep_delay <= 0)`: Filters flights that arrived more than two hours late but left on time or early.
- `filter( (dep_time >= 0 & dep_time <= 600) | dep_time == 2400)`: Filters flights departing between midnight and 6am (using military time). The condition `dep_time == 2400` is included because, in this data.frame, midnight is represented as `2400` rather than `0`.
	-	This last question involves more advanced techniques, so it wonâ€™t be included in the exams at this level.

## Question 2
- How many flights have a missing `dep_time`?

**Answer**:
```{r}
missing_dep_time_flights <- flights |> filter(is.na(dep_time))
n_missing_dep_time <- nrow(missing_dep_time_flights)
n_missing_dep_time
```


We use `filter(is.na(dep_time))` to find flights where the `dep_time` is missing, and `nrow()` to count the number of such flights.

## Question 3
- Sort flights to find the most delayed flights.

**Answer**:
```{r}
# either dep_delay, arr_delay, or both can be used for this task
most_delayed_flights <- flights |> arrange(desc(dep_delay)) 
```

`arrange(desc(dep_delay))` sorts flights in descending order of departure delay (`dep_delay`), placing the flights with the longest departure delays at the top.


```{r}
#| echo: false

DT::datatable(most_delayed_flights |> slice(1:100))
```

## Question 4
- Was there a flight on every day of 2013?

**Answer**:
```{r}
# checking there is only one unique value in year variable, that is 2013.
flights |> distinct(year) # tibble is another name of data.frame in R tidyverse

flights_per_day <- flights |> distinct(month, day)
num_days_2013 <- nrow(flights_per_day)
num_days_2013 == 365
```


- We use `distinct(month, day)` to find unique combinations of `month` and `day`, and then count the number of distinct days using `nrow()`. We check if this equals 365 to determine if there was a flight on every day of the year.
  -  `nrow()` returns the number of observations in a data.frame.
