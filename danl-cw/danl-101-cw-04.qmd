## Question 1
- Find all flights that had an arrival delay of two or more hours
- Find all flights that flew to Houston (`IAH` or `HOU`)
- Find all flights that departed in summer (July, August, and September)
- Find all flights that arrived more than two hours late, but didnâ€™t leave late
- Find all flights that departed between midnight and 6am (inclusive)

**Answer**:
```{r}
library(tidyverse)
flights <- nycflights13::flights

# Flights with arrival delay of 2 or more hours
delayed_flights <- flights |> filter(arr_delay >= 120)  # The unit of the `arr_delay` variable is in a minute.

# Flights to Houston (IAH or HOU)
houston_flights <- flights |> filter( dest == "IAH" | dest == "HOU" )

# Flights that departed in summer (July, August, September)
summer_flights <- flights |> filter( month == 7 | month == 8 | month == 9 )

# Flights that arrived more than two hours late but didnâ€™t leave late
late_arrival_on_time_departure <- flights |> filter( arr_delay > 120 & dep_delay <= 0 )

# Flights that departed between midnight and 6am (inclusive)
early_morning_flights <- flights |> filter( (dep_time >= 0 & dep_time <= 600) | dep_time == 2400 )
```


- `filter(arr_delay >= 120)`: Finds flights with an arrival delay of two or more hours.
- `filter( dest == "IAH" | dest == "HOU" )`: Filters flights flying to Houston by checking if the `dest` variable matches "IAH" or "HOU".
- `filter( month == 7 | month == 8 | month == 9 )`: Filters flights based on the `month` variable for July, August, and September.
- `filter(arr_delay > 120 & dep_delay <= 0)`: Filters flights that arrived more than two hours late but left on time or early.
- `filter( (dep_time >= 0 & dep_time <= 600) | dep_time == 2400)`: Filters flights departing between midnight and 6am (using military time). The condition `dep_time == 2400` is included because, in this data.frame, midnight is represented as `2400` rather than `0`.
	-	This last question involves more advanced techniques, so it wonâ€™t be included in the exams at this level.
