For this Classwork 5, consider the following data.frame, `nyc_payroll_new`.

```{r}
#| echo: true
library(tidyverse)
nyc_payroll_new <- read_csv("https://bcdanl.github.io/data/nyc_payroll_2024.csv")
```

```{r}
#| echo: false
DT::datatable(nyc_payroll_new)
```

<br>

For detailed descriptions of the variables in this data.frame, please refer to the following link: [Citywide Payroll Data (Fiscal Year)](https://data.cityofnewyork.us/City-Government/Citywide-Payroll-Data-Fiscal-Year-/k397-673e/about_data)

<br>

## Question 1
Create a new data.frame, `df` that keeps only the following five variables---`Fiscal_Year`, `Agency_Name`, `First_Name`, `Last_Name`, and `Base_Salary`---from the data.frame `nyc_payroll_new`.

**Answer**:

```{r}
df <- nyc_payroll_new |> 
  select(Fiscal_Year, Agency_Name,
         First_Name, Last_Name,
         Base_Salary)
```

```{r}
#| echo: false

DT::datatable(df)
```


<br><br>

## Question 2
Given the data.frame `df` with a variable named `Agency_Name`, how would you rename it to `Agency`?

**Answer**:

```{r}
df_renamed <- df |> rename(Agency = Agency_Name)
```


```{r}
#| echo: false

DT::datatable(df_renamed)
```


<br><br>

## Question 3
Given the data.frame `df` with variable `Base_Salary`, how would you create a new variable `Adjusted_Salary` that is `Base_Salary` * 1.1 using `mutate()`?

**Answer**:
```{r}
df_new <- df |> mutate(Adjusted_Salary = Base_Salary * 1.1)
```



```{r}
#| echo: false

DT::datatable(df_new)
```

<br><br>

## Question 4
How would you remove the `Fiscal_Year` variable using `select()`?

**Answer**:

```{r}
df_dropped <- df |> select(-Fiscal_Year)
```



```{r}
#| echo: false

DT::datatable(df_dropped)
```

<br><br>

## Question 5
How would you select only `Agency_Name` (or `Agency`) and `Base_Salary` and then create a new variable `Bonus` which is 10% of `Base_Salary`?

**Answer**:
```{r}
df_new <- df |> 
  select(Agency_Name, Base_Salary) |> 
  mutate(Bonus = Base_Salary * 0.1)
```


```{r}
#| echo: false

DT::datatable(df_new)
```
