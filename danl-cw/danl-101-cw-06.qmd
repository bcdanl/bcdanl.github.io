For this Classwork 6, consider the following data.frame, `nyc_payroll_new`.

```{r}
#| echo: true
library(tidyverse)
nyc_payroll_new <- read_csv("https://bcdanl.github.io/data/nyc_payroll_2024.csv")
```

```{r}
#| echo: false
DT::datatable(nyc_payroll_new)
```

<br>

For detailed descriptions of the variables in this data.frame, please refer to the following link: [Citywide Payroll Data (Fiscal Year)](https://data.cityofnewyork.us/City-Government/Citywide-Payroll-Data-Fiscal-Year-/k397-673e/about_data)

<br>

## Question 1
Create a new data.frame, `df` that keeps only the following five variables---`Fiscal_Year`, `Agency_Name`, `First_Name`, `Last_Name`, and `Base_Salary`---from the data.frame `nyc_payroll_new`.

**Answer**:

```{r}
df <- nyc_payroll_new |> 
  select(Fiscal_Year, Agency_Name,
         First_Name, Last_Name,
         Base_Salary)
```


Here, we use the `select()` function from one of the packages in `tidyverse` to choose only the specified variables (`Fiscal_Year`, `Agency_Name`, `First_Name`, `Last_Name`, and `Base_Salary`) from the `nyc_payroll_new` data.frame. The result is assigned to a new data.frame name `df` containing only these variables, reducing the dataset for further analysis.

```{r}
#| echo: false
DT::datatable(df)
```

## Question 2
Given the data.frame `df` with a variable named `Agency_Name`, how would you rename it to `Agency`?

**Answer**:

```{r}
df_renamed <- df |> rename(Agency = Agency_Name)
```


The `rename()` function allows us to change the name of an existing variable. In this case, we rename the `Agency_Name` variable to `Agency` in the `df` data.frame. The result is a new data.frame, `df_renamed`, where `Agency_Name` is now simply `Agency`.

```{r}
#| echo: false
DT::datatable(df_renamed)
```

<br><br>

## Question 3
How would you remove the `Fiscal_Year` variable using `select()`?

**Answer**:

```{r}
df_dropped <- df |> select(-Fiscal_Year)
```


To remove a column from a data.frame, we use the `select()` function with the `-` sign before the variable name. In this case, `select(-Fiscal_Year)` removes the `Fiscal_Year` variable from the `df` data.frame, resulting in `df_dropped`, which contains all variables except `Fiscal_Year`.

```{r}
#| echo: false
DT::datatable(df_dropped)
```
