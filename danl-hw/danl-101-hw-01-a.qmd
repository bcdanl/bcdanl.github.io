```{r}
#| include: false

library(tidyverse)
library(skimr)
library(DT)
library(hrbrthemes)

theme_set(theme_ipsum() +
          theme(strip.background =element_rect(fill="lightgray"),
                axis.title.x = element_text(size = rel(1.5)),
                axis.title.y = element_text(size = rel(1.5)),
                legend.title = element_text(size=rel(1.25))
                ))

x <- c(5, 7, 6, 9, 100, 8, 5, 7, 6)
q1 <- quantile(x, 0.25)
q3 <- quantile(x, 0.75)
iqr_value <- q3 - q1
```


# R Basics

## Question 1
Compute the weighted mean of the vector `scores <- c(85, 90, 88, 92, 87)` with corresponding weights `weights <- c(1, 2, 1, 1, 3)`.

**Answer**:
```{r}
# Define the scores vector
scores <- c(85, 90, 88, 92, 87)

# Define the corresponding weights vector
weights <- c(1, 2, 1, 1, 3)

# Compute the weighted mean by summing the products of scores and weights and dividing by the sum of weights
weighted_mean <- sum(scores * weights) / sum(weights)
```

Therefore the weighted mean is **88.25**.

## Question 2
Compute the interquartile range (IQR) of the following vector `x <- c(5, 7, 6, 9, 100, 8, 5, 7, 6)` manually, without using the `IQR()` function.

**Answer**:
```{r}
# Define the data vector
x <- c(5, 7, 6, 9, 100, 8, 5, 7, 6)

# Compute the first quartile (Q1)
q1 <- quantile(x, 0.25)

# Compute the third quartile (Q3)
q3 <- quantile(x, 0.75)

# Calculate the interquartile range (IQR)
iqr_value <- q3 - q1
```

Therefore the IQR is **2**.


<br><br>

## Question 3
Detect the outliers in the vector `x <- c(5, 7, 6, 9, 100, 8, 5, 7, 6)` using the 1.5*IQR rule.

**Answer**:
```{r}
# Calculate the lower bound for outliers using Q1 and the IQR
lower_bound <- q1 - 1.5 * iqr_value

# Calculate the upper bound for outliers using Q3 and the IQR
upper_bound <- q3 + 1.5 * iqr_value

# Find any values in the data vector that are below the lower bound (lower outliers)
outliers_lower <- x[x < lower_bound]

# Find any values in the data vector that are above the upper bound (upper outliers)
outliers_upper <- x[x > upper_bound]
```

There is one single value, **100**, that belongs to `outliers_upper`. There is no lower outlier.

## Question 4
Calculate the skewness of the vector `x <- c(3, 5, 8, 12, 14, 15, 18, 20)` without using any external R package. Skewness is defined as:
$$
\text{Skewness} \,=\, \frac{n}{(n-1)(n-2)}\sum\left(\frac{x_{i}-\bar{x}}{s}\right)^{3}
$$
where $s$ is the standard deviation of the vector `x`.


**Answer**:
```{r}
# Define the data vector
x <- c(3, 5, 8, 12, 14, 15, 18, 20)

# Calculate the number of elements (n) in the vector
n <- length(x)

# Compute the mean of the vector
mean_x <- mean(x)

# Compute the standard deviation of the vector
sd_x <- sd(x)

# Calculate skewness using the formula provided
skewness <- ( n / ( (n-1) * (n-2) ) ) * sum( ( (x - mean_x)/sd_x )^3 )
```

Therefore `skewness` is approximately `-0.2337`.

<br><br>

## Question 5
Calculate `mode_v`, the mode of a numeric vector `v <- c(2, 3, 5, 5, 6, 7, 3)` using the `mfv()` function provided by the R package `modeest`.

**Answer**:
```{r}
# Define the vector of data
v <- c(2, 3, 5, 5, 6, 7, 3, 5)

# Use the modeest package's mfv() function to calculate the mode
mode_v <- modeest::mfv(v)
```

To use `modeest::mfv()`, we first install the `modeest` package:

```{r}
#| eval: false

# Install the modeest package
install.packages("modeest")
```


The notation `modeest::mfv()` indicates that we are using the `mfv()` function from the `modeest` package. The `::` operator specifies which package the function or the object is coming from.

<br><br>

## Question 6
Calculate, `z`, the vector for the standardized values in the vector `x <- c(10, 20, 30, 40, 50)`. The standardized value of the individual value, $z_{i}$, is defined as:

$$
z_{i} \,=\, \frac{x_{i} - \bar{x}}{s},
$$
where\
$\quad$ - $x_{i}$: $i^{th}$ value in the vector $x$\
$\quad$ - $\bar{x}$: the mean of values in $x$\
$\quad$ - $s$: the standard deviation of values in $x$\
$\quad$ - $z_{i}$: $i^{th}$ value in the vector $z$, the vector of the standardized values in $x$.


**Answer**:
```{r}
# Define the data vector
x <- c(10, 20, 30, 40, 50)

# Calculate the standardized values (z-scores) for each element in x
z <- (x - mean(x)) / sd(x)
```

# Short-Answer Questions

1.	Data analytics aims to replace traditional business and economics courses. (False)
	-	Data analytics is seen as a complement to traditional business and economics courses, enhancing decision-making with data-driven insights rather than replacing foundational business knowledge.
<br><br>

2.	Data analysts are the only professionals who benefit from data analytics skills. (False)
	-	Many professionals, including marketers, financial analysts, healthcare professionals, and even educators, benefit from data analytics skills as they apply to various fields.
<br><br>

3.	Python and R are the only programming languages used in data science. (False)
	-	While Python and R are popular in data science, other languages like SQL, MATLAB, and even JavaScript are also used depending on the application.
<br><br>
	
4.	The use of generative AI requires a deep understanding of the subject matter to apply it effectively. (True)
	-	To use generative AI effectively, it is essential to have a solid understanding of the subject area to interpret and apply the results accurately.
<br><br>

5.	Machine learning algorithms need to be explicitly programmed for each task they perform. (False)
	-	Machine learning algorithms learn patterns from data, meaning they donâ€™t need explicit programming for each task. Instead, they adapt and improve their performance based on the data provided.
<br><br>

6.	Which of the following skills is NOT typically covered in traditional business or economics classes?
