# Descriptive Statistics

The following provides the descriptive statistics for each part of the homework, as well as the final score of HW1:

```{r}
#| echo: false
#| eval: true
sum <- readr::read_csv("https://bcdanl.github.io/data/danl-101-hw1-dist-fall-2024.csv")
DT::datatable(sum, options = list(pageLength = 25))

# R Basics

## Question 1
Compute the weighted mean of the vector `scores <- c(85, 90, 88, 92, 87)` with corresponding weights `weights <- c(1, 2, 1, 1, 3)`.

**Answer**:
```{r}
# Define the scores vector
scores <- c(85, 90, 88, 92, 87)

# Define the corresponding weights vector
weights <- c(1, 2, 1, 1, 3)

# Compute the weighted mean by summing the products of scores and weights and dividing by the sum of weights
weighted_mean <- sum(scores * weights) / sum(weights)
```

Therefore the weighted mean is **88.25**.


- To clarify the difference between the arithmetic mean and the weighted mean:
  - **Arithmetic mean**: This is the simple average where all values are treated equally. You sum all the values and divide by the number of values. 
  - **Weighted mean**: This takes into account the weights assigned to each value. Each value is multiplied by its corresponding weight, and then the sum of these products is divided by the total sum of the weights.

- Example:
  - Let's say you have a vector of values: `x <- c(2, 4, 6)`. And corresponding weights: `w <- c(1, 2, 3)`.
  - For the arithmetic mean, you would ignore the weights and simply find the average of the values:  
    - `(Arithmetic mean) = (2 + 4 + 6) / 3 = 4`
  - For the weighted mean, you would multiply each value by its corresponding weight and then divide by the sum of the weights: 
    - `(Weighted mean) = ( (1 * 2) + (2 * 4) + (3 * 6) ) / ( 1 + 2 + 3 ) = 4.67`

## Question 2
Compute the interquartile range (IQR) of the following vector `x <- c(5, 7, 6, 9, 100, 8, 5, 7, 6)` manually, without using the `IQR()` function.

**Answer**:
```{r}
# Define the data vector
x <- c(5, 7, 6, 9, 100, 8, 5, 7, 6)

# Compute the first quartile (Q1)
q1 <- quantile(x, 0.25)

# Compute the third quartile (Q3)
q3 <- quantile(x, 0.75)

# Calculate the interquartile range (IQR)
iqr_value <- q3 - q1
```

Therefore the IQR is **2**.


<br><br>

## Question 3
Detect the outliers in the vector `x <- c(5, 7, 6, 9, 100, 8, 5, 7, 6)` using the 1.5*IQR rule.

**Answer**:
```{r}
# Calculate the lower bound for outliers using Q1 and the IQR
lower_bound <- q1 - 1.5 * iqr_value

# Calculate the upper bound for outliers using Q3 and the IQR
upper_bound <- q3 + 1.5 * iqr_value

# Find any values in the data vector that are below the lower bound (lower outliers)
outliers_lower <- x[ x < lower_bound ]

# Find any values in the data vector that are above the upper bound (upper outliers)
outliers_upper <- x[ x > upper_bound ]
```

There is one single value, **100**, that belongs to `outliers_upper`. There is no lower outlier.

- This rule is described in [this lecture slide](https://bcdanl.github.io/101/danl-lec/danl-101-lec-06-2024-0912.html?q=box#/measures-of-dispersion-5).

- Although we primarily use `filter()` with data.frame, understanding vector indexing is a fundamental skill in data analysis.
  - [Lecture 7](https://bcdanl.github.io/101/danl-lec/danl-101-lec-07-2024-0917.html?q=vector%20ind#/title-slide) covers vector indexing.

## Question 4
Calculate the skewness of the vector `x <- c(3, 5, 8, 12, 14, 15, 18, 20)` without using any external R package. Skewness is defined as:
$$
\text{Skewness} \,=\, \frac{n}{(n-1)(n-2)}\sum\left(\frac{x_{i}-\bar{x}}{s}\right)^{3}
$$
where $s$ is the standard deviation of the vector `x`.


**Answer**:
```{r}
# Define the data vector
x <- c(3, 5, 8, 12, 14, 15, 18, 20)

# Calculate the number of elements (n) in the vector
n <- length(x)

# Compute the mean of the vector
mean_x <- mean(x)

# Compute the standard deviation of the vector
sd_x <- sd(x)

# Calculate skewness using the formula provided
skewness <- ( n / ( (n-1) * (n-2) ) ) * sum( ( (x - mean_x)/sd_x )^3 )
```

Therefore `skewness` is approximately `-0.2337`.

-	You do not need to memorize the formula for skewness in our course.
  -	The question is about translating a complex formula into R code.

## Question 5
Calculate `mode_v`, the mode of a numeric vector `v <- c(2, 3, 5, 5, 6, 7, 3)` using the `mfv()` function provided by the R package `modeest`.

**Answer**:
```{r}
# Define the vector of data
v <- c(2, 3, 5, 5, 6, 7, 3, 5)

# Use the modeest package's mfv() function to calculate the mode
mode_v <- modeest::mfv(v)
```

To use `modeest::mfv()`, we first install the `modeest` package:

```{r}
#| eval: false

# Install the modeest package
install.packages("modeest")
```


The notation `modeest::mfv()` indicates that we are using the `mfv()` function from the `modeest` package. The `::` operator specifies which package the function or the object is coming from.

<br><br>

## Question 6
Calculate, `z`, the vector for the standardized values in the vector `x <- c(10, 20, 30, 40, 50)`. The standardized value of the individual value, $z_{i}$, is defined as:

$$
z_{i} \,=\, \frac{x_{i} - \bar{x}}{s},
$$
where\
$\quad$ - $x_{i}$: $i^{th}$ value in the vector $x$\
$\quad$ - $\bar{x}$: the mean of values in $x$\
$\quad$ - $s$: the standard deviation of values in $x$\
$\quad$ - $z_{i}$: $i^{th}$ value in the vector $z$, the vector of the standardized values in $x$.


**Answer**:
```{r}
# Define the data vector
x <- c(10, 20, 30, 40, 50)

# Calculate the standardized values (z-scores) for each element in x
z <- (x - mean(x)) / sd(x)
```

-	Please note that the R objects `mean_x` and `sd_x` defined in Question 4 are not used in this question.
