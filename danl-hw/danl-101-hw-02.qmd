<!-- ## Data Preparation and Management with R -->

<!-- For the questions in the R section, consider the data.frame `nyc_payroll_new`. For detailed descriptions of the variables in this data.frame, please refer to the following link: [Citywide Payroll Data (Fiscal Year)](https://data.cityofnewyork.us/City-Government/Citywide-Payroll-Data-Fiscal-Year-/k397-673e/about_data). -->


<!-- ```{r} -->
<!-- library(tidyverse) -->
<!-- library(skimr) -->
<!-- nyc_payroll_new <- read_csv("https://bcdanl.github.io/data/nyc_payroll_2024.csv") -->
<!-- ``` -->

<!-- ### Question 1 -->

<!-- How can you filter the data to calculate descriptive statistics (mean and standard deviation) of `Base_Salary` for workers in the `work_location_borough` **"Manhattan"**? Similarly, how can you filter the data to calculate these statistics for workers in the `work_location_borough` **"Queens"**? -->

<!-- Provide the R code for performing these calculations and then report the mean and standard deviation of `base_salary` for workers in both “Manhattan” and “Queens”. -->



<!-- ### Question 2 -->

<!-- How can you filter the data.frame `nyc_payroll_new` to show only the records where the `base_salary` is greater than or equal to $100,000? -->

<!-- Complete the code by filling in the blank: -->

<!-- ```{r} -->
<!-- nyc_payroll_new |> -->
<!--   filter(__BLANK__) -->
<!-- ``` -->

<!-- ### Question 3 -->

<!-- How can you select only distinct combinations of `agency_name` and `title_description`? -->

<!-- Complete the code by filling in the blank: -->

<!-- ```{r} -->
<!-- nyc_payroll_new |>  -->
<!--   __BLANK__ -->
<!-- ``` -->

<!-- ### Question 4 -->

<!-- How would you arrange the data by `regular_gross_paid` in descending order, showing the highest paid employees first? -->

<!-- Complete the code by filling in the blanks: -->

<!-- ```{r} -->
<!-- nyc_payroll_new |>  -->
<!--   __BLANK__ -->
<!-- ``` -->

<!-- ### Question 5 -->

<!-- How can you select and rename the `title_description` variable to `title`? -->

<!-- Complete the code by filling in the blank: -->

<!-- ```{r} -->
<!-- nyc_payroll_new |>  -->
<!--   rename(__BLANK__) -->
<!-- ``` -->



<!-- ### Question 6 -->

<!-- How can you filter the data to show only records for the **"POLICE DEPARTMENT"** `agency_name` and arrange it by `total_ot_paid` in ascending order? -->

<!-- Complete the code by filling in the blanks: -->

<!-- ```{r} -->
<!-- nyc_payroll_new |>  -->
<!--   filter(__BLANK 1__) |>  -->
<!--   arrange(__BLANK 2__) -->
<!-- ``` -->



<!-- ### Question 7 -->

<!-- How can you filter the data to include only those records where the `pay_basis` is **"per Annum"** and then select only the `first_name`, `last_name`, and `base_salary` variables? -->

<!-- Complete the code by filling in the blanks: -->

<!-- ```{r} -->
<!-- nyc_payroll_new |>  -->
<!--   filter(__BLANK 1__) |>  -->
<!--   select(__BLANK 2__, __BLANK 3__, __BLANK 4__) -->
<!-- ``` -->

<!-- ### Question 8 -->

<!-- How would you  arrange the data.frame by `borough` in ascending order and `base_salary` in descending order? -->

<!-- Complete the code by filling in the blanks: -->

<!-- ```{r} -->
<!-- nyc_payroll_new |>  -->
<!--   __BLANK__ -->
<!-- ``` -->


<!-- ### Question 9 -->
<!-- How can you filter the `nyc_payroll_new` data.frame to remove observations where the `base_salary` variable has `NA` values? After filtering, how would you calculate the total number of remaining observations? -->

<!-- Provide the R code needed to perform these data extraction tasks. -->
