## Why Data Analytics?

- Fill in the gaps left by traditional business and economics classes.
  - Practical skills that will benefit your future career.
  - Neglected skills like how to actually find datasets in the wild and clean them.

- Data analytics skills are largely distinct from (and complementary to) the core quantitative works familiar to business undergrads.
  - Data visualization, cleaning and wrangling; databases; machine learning; etc.

- In short, we will cover things that I wish someone had taught me when I was undergraduate.

## Why Data Analytics?

- **Data analysts** use analytical tools and techniques to extract meaningful insights from data.
  - Skills in data analytics are also useful for **business analysts** or **market analysts**.


- [Breau of Labor Statistics](https://www.bls.gov/ooh/math/data-scientists.htm){target="_blank"} forecasts that the projected growth rate of the employment in the industry related to data analytics from 2021 to 2031 is **36%**. 
  - The average growth rate for all occupations is **5%**.





## Why R, Python, and Databases?

## The State of the Art
### Generative AI and ChatGPT

- **Generative AI** refers to a category of artificial intelligence (AI) that is capable of generating new content, ranging from text, images, and videos to music and code. 

:::{.incremental}

- In the early 2020s, advances in transformer-based deep neural networks enabled a number of generative AI systems notable for accepting natural language prompts as input.
  - These include large language model (LLM) chatbots (e.g., ChatGPT, Claude, Copilot, Gemini, LLaMA, Grok).

- **ChatGPT** (Chat Generative Pre-trained Transformer) is a chatbot developed by OpenAI and launched on November 30, 2022. 
  - By January 2023, it had become what was then the fastest-growing consumer software application in history.

:::

::: {.column width="55%"}

$\quad$

- **Git** is the most popular **version control** tool for any software development.
  - It tracks changes in a series of snapshots of the project, allowing developers to revert to previous versions, compare changes, and merge different versions. 
  - It is the industry standard and ubiquitous for coding collaboration.

## What is GitHub?

- [GitHub](https://github.com/){target="_blank"} is a web-based hosting platform for Git repositories to store, manage, and share code. 

- Out class website is hosted on a GitHub repository.

- Course contents will be posted not only in Brightspace but also in our GitHub repositories ("repos") and websites.

- Github is useful for many reasons, but the main reason is how user friendly it makes uploading and sharing code.

## What is R?

- **R** is a programming language and software environment designed for statistical computing and graphics. 

- R has become a major tool in data analysis, statistical modeling, and visualization. 
  - It is widely used among statisticians and data scientists for developing statistical software and performing data analysis. 
  - R is open source and freely available. 


## What is RStudio?

- **RStudio** is an integrated development environment (IDE) for R. 
  - An IDE is a software application that provides comprehensive facilities (e.g., text code editor, graphical user interface (GUI)) to computer programmers for software development. 

- RStudio is a user-friendly interface that makes using R easier and more interactive. 
  - It provides a console, syntax-highlighting editor that supports direct code execution, as well as tools for plotting, history, debugging, and workspace management.

- We will use a free cloud version of RStudio, which is [**Posit Cloud**](https://posit.cloud).



## What is Python?

- **Python** is a versatile programming language known for its simplicity and readability.

- Python has become a dominant tool in various fields including data analysis, machine learning, and web development.
  - It is widely used among developers, data scientists, and researchers for building applications and performing data-driven tasks.
  - Python is open source and has a vast ecosystem of libraries and frameworks.



## What is Jupyter?

- **Jupyter** is an open-source integrated development environment (IDE) primarily for Python, though it supports many other languages.
  - Jupyter provides a notebook interface that allows users to write and execute code in a more interactive and visual format.

- Jupyter Notebook is a user-friendly environment that enhances coding, data analysis, and visualization.
  - It offers a web-based interface that combines live code, equations, visualizations, and narrative text.
  - Jupyter is widely used for data science, machine learning, and research, enabling easy sharing and collaboration.

- We will use a free cloud version of Jupyter, which is [**Google Colab**](https://colab.research.google.com).

# Sports Analytics---Understanding Applications of Data Anlytics {background-color="#1c4982"}


## Sports Analytics
### Moneyball's Impact

- The use of data analytics for sports was popularized by the *Moneyball* book by Michael Lewis in 2003 and the movie starring Brad Pitt and Jonah Hill in 2011.

## What is Sports Analytics?

- Sports analytics is the use of data analysis and statistical techniques to evaluate and improve the performance of athletes, teams, and organizations in sports.

- It involves collecting and analyzing data related to various aspects of sports:
  - Player Performance Analysis
  - Team Tactics Analysis
  - Injury Prevention and Recovery
  - Recruitment and Scouting
  - Fan Engagement and Business Operations





## Fan Analytics

- The types of questions for fan analytics would be:
  - Why do season ticket holders renew their tickets?
  - What factors drive last-minute individual seat ticket purchases?
  - How to price the tickets?

<div style="text-align: center; width: 80%; margin: auto;">
  <img src="https://bcdanl.github.io/lec_figs/season-ticket-renewal.png" style="width: 90%; margin-bottom: -20px;">
  <p style="font-style: bold;">Season Ticket Renewals---Likelihood to Purchase Again</p>
</div>


- e.g., 69% of fans in Tier 1 seats who said on the survey that they would "probably not" renew actually did.


## Fan Analytics


<p align="center">
  <img src="https://bcdanl.github.io/lec_figs/ticket-pricing.png" style="width: 60%;">
</p>

- Business offices at sports team do dynamic pricing:
  - It adjusts ticket prices based on various factors such as the team’s performance, opponent, game time, and real-time data like weather and traffic.



## Team Tactics
### Decision Tree for Run or Pass Plays in Football

<!-- - The following tree helps predicting whether the next play will be a running play or passing play. -->

<div style="text-align: center; width: 80%; margin: auto;">
  <img src="https://bcdanl.github.io/lec_figs/decision-tree-football.png" style="width: 100%; margin-bottom: -20px;">
  <p style="font-style: bold;">Run of Pass in the Next Play</p>
</div>


Q. When does a football team sees an opponent team's personnel formation that looks like a pass, and it is third or fourth down with more than 5 yards to go, how likely the opponent team will pass in the next play?




## Hockey Player Performance

:::{.incremental}


- The player “plus-minus” (PM) is a common hockey performance metric.

- The classic PM is a function of goals scored while that player is on the ice: 
  - The number of goals for his team minus the number against.

- The limits of this approach are obvious: 
  - There is no accounting for teammates or opponents.

- In hockey, where players tend to be grouped together on “lines” and coaches will “line match” against opponents, a player’s PM can be artificially inflated or deflated by the play of his opponents and peers.

- Here, we instead use **machine learning** methods to analyze how likely making a goal is associated with whether or not a player is on the ice.
  - How is the presence of a legend player, e.g., Peter Forsberg or Sidney Crosby, associated with the likelihood of making a goal?
