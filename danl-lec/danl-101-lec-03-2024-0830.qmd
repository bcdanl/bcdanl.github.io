- The use of data analytics for sports was popularized by the *Moneyball* book by Michael Lewis in 2003 and the movie starring Brad Pitt and Jonah Hill in 2011.

## What is Sports Analytics?

- **Sports analytics** is the use of data analysis and statistical techniques, such as, **machine learning**, to evaluate and improve the performance of athletes, teams, and organizations in sports.

- It involves collecting and analyzing data related to various aspects of sports:
  - Player Performance Analysis
  - Team Tactics Analysis
  - Injury Prevention and Recovery
  - Recruitment and Scouting
  - Fan Engagement and Business Operations




## What is Machine Learning?

- **Machine Learning** (ML) algorithm allows computers to learn from data and improve their performance on tasks without being explicitly programmed.

- **How Does It Work?**
  - Computers are given large amounts of data.
  - They use statistical algorithms (step-by-step instructions with statistics) to find patterns in that data.
  - Based on these patterns, the computer makes predictions or decisions.

## 1. Fan Analytics

  <p style="font-weight: bold;">Season Ticket Renewals---Likelihood to Purchase Again</p>
</div>

- e.g., 69% of fans in Tier 1 seats who said on the survey that they would "probably not" renew actually did.

- The types of questions for fan analytics would be:
  - Why do season ticket holders renew their tickets?
  - What factors drive last-minute individual seat ticket purchases?
  - How to price the tickets?

</p>

- Business offices at sports team do dynamic pricing:
  - It adjusts ticket prices based on various factors such as the team’s performance, opponent, game time, and real-time data like weather and traffic.



## 2. Team Tactics
### Decision Tree for Run or Pass Plays in Football

  <p style="font-weight: bold;">Run or Pass in the Next Play</p>
</div>

- A *decision tree* is a **machine learning** model that makes decisions by splitting data into branches based on input variables. 
  - *Off_Pers*: Offensive Personnel (e.g., Value “11” meaning 1 running back, 1 tight end, and 3 wide receivers)

## 2. Team Tactics
### Decision Tree for Run or Pass Plays in Football

<div style="text-align: center; width: 80%; margin: auto;">
  <img src="https://bcdanl.github.io/lec_figs/decision-tree-football.png" style="width: 100%; margin-bottom: -20px;">
  <p style="font-weight: bold;">Run or Pass in the Next Play</p>
</div>


- If a football team sees an opponent team's personnel formation that looks like a pass, and it is third or fourth down with more than 5 yards to go, how likely would the opponent team pass in the next play?




## 3. Hockey Player Performance

:::{.incremental}

$$
PM \,=\, (\text{Number of his team's goal}) \,-\, (\text{Number of opponent team's goal}) 
$$

- The player “plus-minus” (PM) is a common hockey performance metric.


- The limits of this approach are obvious: 
  - There is no accounting for teammates or opponents.
  - In hockey, where players tend to be grouped together on “lines” and coaches will “line match” against opponents, a player’s PM can be artificially inflated or deflated by the play of his opponents and peers.

- Here, we instead use **machine learning** methods to analyze how likely making a goal is associated with whether or not a player is on the ice.

## 3. Hockey Player Performance
### Data

- The data comprise of play-by-play NHL game data for regular and playoff games during 11 seasons of 2002-2003 through 2013-2014.


- There were 2,439 players involved in 69,449 goals.


- The data contains information that indicates:
  - Seasons
  - Home & away teams
  - Team configuration such as 5 on 4 powerplay
  - Which players are on & off the ice when a goal is made.

- How is the presence of a legend player, e.g., *Peter Forsberg* or *Sidney Crosby*, associated with the likelihood of making a goal?
