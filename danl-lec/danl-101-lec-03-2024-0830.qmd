# Sports Analytics---Understanding Applications of Data Anlytics {background-color="#1c4982"}


## Sports Analytics
### Moneyball's Impact

<!-- - The use of data analytics for sports was popularized by the *Moneyball* book by Michael Lewis in 2023 and the movie starring Brad Pitt and Jonah Hill. -->

- The use of data analytics for sports was popularized by the *Moneyball* book by Michael Lewis in 2003 and the movie starring Brad Pitt and Jonah Hill in 2011.

## What is Sports Analytics?

- Sports analytics is the use of data analysis and statistical techniques to evaluate and improve the performance of athletes, teams, and organizations in sports.

- It involves collecting and analyzing data related to various aspects of sports:
  - Player Performance Analysis
  - Team Tactics Analysis
  - Injury Prevention and Recovery
  - Recruitment and Scouting
  - Fan Engagement and Business Operations





## Fan Analytics

- The types of questions for fan analytics would be:
  - Why do season ticket holders renew their tickets?
  - What factors drive last-minute individual seat ticket purchases?
  - How to price the tickets?

  <p style="font-style: bold;">Season Ticket Renewals---Likelihood to Purchase Again</p>
</div>


- e.g., 69% of fans in Tier 1 seats who said on the survey that they would "probably not" renew actually did.


## Fan Analytics


<p align="center">
  <img src="https://bcdanl.github.io/lec_figs/ticket-pricing.png" style="width: 60%;">
</p>

- Business offices at sports team do dynamic pricing:
  - It adjusts ticket prices based on various factors such as the team’s performance, opponent, game time, and real-time data like weather and traffic.



## Team Tactics
### Decision Tree for Run or Pass Plays in Football

<!-- - The following tree helps predicting whether the next play will be a running play or passing play. -->

<div style="text-align: center; width: 80%; margin: auto;">
  <img src="https://bcdanl.github.io/lec_figs/decision-tree-football.png" style="width: 100%; margin-bottom: -20px;">
  <p style="font-style: bold;">Run of Pass in the Next Play</p>
</div>


- If a football team sees an opponent team's personnel formation that looks like a pass, and it is third or fourth down with more than 5 yards to go, how likely would the opponent team pass in the next play?




## Hockey Player Performance

:::{.incremental}

$$
PM \,=\, (\text{Number of his team's goal}) \,-\, (\text{Number of opponent team's goal}) 
$$

- The player “plus-minus” (PM) is a common hockey performance metric.


- The limits of this approach are obvious: 
  - There is no accounting for teammates or opponents.
  - In hockey, where players tend to be grouped together on “lines” and coaches will “line match” against opponents, a player’s PM can be artificially inflated or deflated by the play of his opponents and peers.

- Here, we instead use **machine learning** methods to analyze how likely making a goal is associated with whether or not a player is on the ice.

:::

## Hockey Player Performance
### Data

- The data comprise of play-by-play NHL game data for regular and playoff games during 11 seasons of 2002-2003 through 2013-2014.

-  There were 2,439 players involved in 69,449 goals.

-  The data contains information that indicates:
  - Seasons, 
  - Home & away teams, 
  - Team configuration such as 5 on 4 powerplay,
  - Which players are on & off the ice when a goal is made.


## Hockey Player Performance

- How is the presence of a legend player, e.g., Peter Forsberg or Sidney Crosby, associated with the likelihood of making a goal?

- **Machine Learning** (ML) algorithm allows computers to learn from data and improve their performance on tasks without being explicitly programmed.

- **How Does It Work?**
  - Computers are given large amounts of data.
  - They use statistical algorithms (step-by-step instructions with statistics) to find patterns in that data.
  - Based on these patterns, the computer makes predictions or decisions.

# A Framework for Business Intelligence (BI) {background-color="#1c4982"}

## Definitions of BI

- **Business Intelligence (BI)** is a technology-driven process that involves the collection, integration, analysis, and presentation of business data to support better decision-making. 

- BI tools and systems allow organizations to gather data from various sources, process it into actionable insights, and visualize it in a way that is easily understandable by decision-makers.

## Key components of BI

- **Data Collection:** Gathering data from various internal and external sources, such as databases, spreadsheets, and cloud services.
  
- **Data Integration:** Combining data from different sources into a unified view, often involving data warehousing.
  
- **Data Analysis:** Applying statistical and computational methods to identify trends, patterns, and insights from the data.
  
- **Reporting and Visualization:** Presenting the data through dashboards, reports, and visualizations like charts and graphs to make the information accessible to decision-makers.

## Purpose of BI
- **Informed Decision-Making:** BI enables organizations to make data-driven decisions by providing insights into business performance, market trends, and customer behavior.
- **Performance Management:** BI tools help in monitoring and improving business processes, leading to better performance and efficiency.
- **Competitive Advantage:** By analyzing market and competitor data, organizations can identify opportunities and threats, allowing them to stay ahead in the market.

- BI is widely used across industries for various applications, including financial analysis, customer relationship management (CRM), supply chain management, and marketing strategy optimization.


## BI Tools
Business Intelligence (BI) tools are software applications that help organizations analyze data and provide actionable insights to support decision-making. Here are some of the popular BI tools:

1. **Microsoft Power BI:**
   - A widely used BI tool that offers data visualization, business analytics, and reporting. It integrates well with Microsoft products and allows users to create interactive dashboards.

2. **Tableau:**
   - Known for its strong data visualization capabilities, Tableau allows users to create interactive and shareable dashboards. It connects to various data sources and supports real-time data analysis.

5. **Looker:**
   - A BI tool that focuses on data exploration and real-time analytics. Looker uses a unique modeling language called LookML, which allows data teams to define business metrics and logic.

10. **Google Data Studio:**
    - A free BI tool that integrates well with Google’s ecosystem, including Google Analytics, Google Sheets, and BigQuery. It provides interactive dashboards and reports.

These tools cater to different needs, from small businesses to large enterprises, and offer varying levels of complexity and features depending on the organization's requirements.
