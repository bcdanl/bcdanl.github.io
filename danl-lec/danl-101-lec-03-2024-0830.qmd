## Sports Analytics
### Moneyball's Impact

<!-- - The use of data analytics for sports was popularized by the *Moneyball* book by Michael Lewis in 2023 and the movie starring Brad Pitt and Jonah Hill. -->

- The use of data analytics for sports was popularized by the *Moneyball* book by Michael Lewis in 2003 and the movie starring Brad Pitt and Jonah Hill in 2011.

## What is Sports Analytics?

- Sports analytics is the use of data analysis and statistical techniques to evaluate and improve the performance of athletes, teams, and organizations in sports.

- It involves collecting and analyzing data related to various aspects of sports:
  - Player Performance Analysis
  - Team Tactics Analysis
  - Injury Prevention and Recovery
  - Recruitment and Scouting
  - Fan Engagement and Business Operations





## Fan Analytics

- The types of questions for fan analytics would be:
  - Why do season ticket holders renew their tickets?
  - What factors drive last-minute individual seat ticket purchases?
  - How to price the tickets?

  <p style="font-style: bold;">Season Ticket Renewals---Likelihood to Purchase Again</p>
</div>


- e.g., 69% of fans in Tier 1 seats who said on the survey that they would "probably not" renew actually did.


## Fan Analytics


<p align="center">

</p>

- Business offices at sports team do dynamic pricing:
  - It adjusts ticket prices based on various factors such as the team’s performance, opponent, game time, and real-time data like weather and traffic.



## Team Tactics
### Decision Tree for Run or Pass Plays in Football

<!-- - The following tree helps predicting whether the next play will be a running play or passing play. -->

<div style="text-align: center; width: 80%; margin: auto;">
  <img src="https://bcdanl.github.io/lec_figs/decision-tree-football.png" style="width: 100%; margin-bottom: -20px;">
  <p style="font-style: bold;">Run of Pass in the Next Play</p>
</div>


- If a football team sees an opponent team's personnel formation that looks like a pass, and it is third or fourth down with more than 5 yards to go, how likely would the opponent team pass in the next play?




## Hockey Player Performance

:::{.incremental}

$$
PM \,=\, (\text{Number of his team's goal}) \,-\, (\text{Number of opponent team's goal}) 
$$

- The player “plus-minus” (PM) is a common hockey performance metric.


- The limits of this approach are obvious: 
  - There is no accounting for teammates or opponents.
  - In hockey, where players tend to be grouped together on “lines” and coaches will “line match” against opponents, a player’s PM can be artificially inflated or deflated by the play of his opponents and peers.

- Here, we instead use **machine learning** methods to analyze how likely making a goal is associated with whether or not a player is on the ice.

:::

## Hockey Player Performance
### Data

- The data comprise of play-by-play NHL game data for regular and playoff games during 11 seasons of 2002-2003 through 2013-2014.

-  There were 2,439 players involved in 69,449 goals.

-  The data contains information that indicates:
  - Seasons, 
  - Home & away teams, 
  - Team configuration such as 5 on 4 powerplay,
  - Which players are on & off the ice when a goal is made.


## Hockey Player Performance

- How is the presence of a legend player, e.g., Peter Forsberg or Sidney Crosby, associated with the likelihood of making a goal?

- **Machine Learning** (ML) algorithm allows computers to learn from data and improve their performance on tasks without being explicitly programmed.

- **How Does It Work?**
  - Computers are given large amounts of data.
  - They use statistical algorithms (step-by-step instructions with statistics) to find patterns in that data.
  - Based on these patterns, the computer makes predictions or decisions.

- **Business Intelligence (BI)** is a process that involves the collection, integration, analysis, and presentation of business data to support better decision-making. 

- **How Does It Work?**
  - **Data Collection:** Gathering data from various sources, like databases.
  - **Data Integration:** Combining data into a unified view.
  - **Data Analysis:** Identifying trends and insights from data.
  - **Reporting and Visualization:** Displaying data via **dashboards**, reports, and visualizations.

## What is a Dashboard?

- A **dashboard** is a visual display of key information, data, and metrics, presented in a way that is easy to read and interpret at a glance.

- Dashboard Examples:
  - [Microsoft Power BI](https://www.geneseo.edu/ir/institutional-research-discovery-dashboards)
  - [Tableau](https://www.tableau.com/learn/articles/business-intelligence-dashboards-examples)
  - [Looker](https://lookerstudio.google.com/u/0/navigation/reporting)
  - [Python and R](https://quarto.org/docs/gallery/#dashboards)
  
  



## Purpose of ML and BI in Business

- **Informed Decision-Making:** BI provides insights from data to support strategic and operational decisions.

- **Performance Monitoring:** Tracks key performance indicators and metrics to ensure goals are met.

- **Data Visualization:** Transforms complex data into easy-to-understand visual formats like dashboards and reports.

- **Operational Efficiency:** Identifies inefficiencies and areas for improvement within business processes.
