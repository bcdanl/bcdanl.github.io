## What is Sports Analytics?

- Sports analytics is the use of data analysis and statistical techniques to evaluate and improve the performance of athletes, teams, and organizations in sports.

- It involves collecting and analyzing data related to various aspects of sports:
  - Player Performance Analysis
  - Team Tactics Analysis
  - Injury Prevention and Recovery
  - Recruitment and Scouting
  - Fan Engagement and Business Operations





## Fan Analytics

- The types of questions for fan analytics would be:
  - Why do season ticket holders renew their tickets?
  - What factors drive last-minute individual seat ticket purchases?
  - How to price the tickets?

  <p style="font-style: bold;">Season Ticket Renewals---Likelihood to Purchase Again</p>
</div>


- e.g., 69% of fans in Tier 1 seats who said on the survey that they would "probably not" renew actually did.

</p>

- Business offices at sports team do dynamic pricing:
  - It adjusts ticket prices based on various factors such as the team’s performance, opponent, game time, and real-time data like weather and traffic.



## Team Tactics
### Decision Tree for Run or Pass Plays in Football

<!-- - The following tree helps predicting whether the next play will be a running play or passing play. -->

<div style="text-align: center; width: 80%; margin: auto;">

  <p style="font-style: bold;">Run of Pass in the Next Play</p>
</div>


Q. When does a football team sees an opponent team's personnel formation that looks like a pass, and it is third or fourth down with more than 5 yards to go, how likely the opponent team will pass in the next play?




## Hockey Player Performance

:::{.incremental}


- The player “plus-minus” (PM) is a common hockey performance metric.

- The classic PM is a function of goals scored while that player is on the ice: 
  - The number of goals for his team minus the number against.

- The limits of this approach are obvious: 
  - There is no accounting for teammates or opponents.

- In hockey, where players tend to be grouped together on “lines” and coaches will “line match” against opponents, a player’s PM can be artificially inflated or deflated by the play of his opponents and peers.

- Here, we instead use **machine learning** methods to analyze how likely making a goal is associated with whether or not a player is on the ice.
  - How is the presence of a legend player, e.g., Peter Forsberg or Sidney Crosby, associated with the likelihood of making a goal?
