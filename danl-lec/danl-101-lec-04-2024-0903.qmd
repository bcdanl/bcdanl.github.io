## Price Elasticity of Orange Juice in Dominick's Supermarket

- To estimate the price elasticity of orange juice (OJ), we will use sales data for OJ from Dominick’s grocery stores in the 1990s.
  - Weekly `price` and `sales` (in number of cartons "sold") for three OJ brands---Tropicana, Minute Maid, Dominick's
  - A dummy, `ad`, showing whether each `brand` was advertised (in store or flyer) that week.
