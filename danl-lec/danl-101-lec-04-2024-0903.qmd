# Data Analytics Workflow---Application of Price Elasticity of Orange Juice {background-color="#1c4982"}


## What is data science?

Data science is a cross-disciplinary practice that draws on methods from data wrangling, data mining, machine learning, and econometrics.


## Example: Estimating the Price Elasticity of Orange Juice in Dominick's Supermarket

- To estimate the price elasticity of orange juice (OJ), we will use sales data for OJ from Dominickâ€™s grocery stores in the 1990s.
  - Weekly `price` and `sales` (in number of cartons "sold") for three OJ brands---Tropicana, Minute Maid, Dominick's
  - A dummy, `ad`, showing whether each `brand` was advertised (in store or flyer) that week.
