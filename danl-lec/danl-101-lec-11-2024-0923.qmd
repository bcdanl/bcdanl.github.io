## A Simple Taxonomy of Data
### Data Types Overview

:::: {.nonincremental}
:::: {.columns}
::: {.column width="50%"}

- **Categorical Data**: Data that can be divided into distinct categories based on some qualitative attribute.
  - **Nominal Data**
  - **Ordinal Data**

:::

::: {.column width="50%"}

- **Numeric Data**: Data that represents measurable quantities and can be subjected to mathematical algebra.
  - **Interval Data**
  - **Ratio Data**

:::

## A Simple Taxonomy of Data
### Categorical Data - Nominal

:::: {.nonincremental}


| ID | Animal |
|----|--------|
| 1  | Dog    |
| 2  | Cat    |
| 3  | Bird   |

- **Nominal Data**: Categorical data where the categories have no intrinsic order or ranking.
- **No Order**: Categories are simply different; there is no logical sequence.
- **Examples**:
  - **Colors**: Red, Blue, Green
  - **Types of Animals**: Dog, Cat, Bird

:::: 

## A Simple Taxonomy of Data
### Categorical Data - Ordinal

:::: {.nonincremental}

| ID | Education Level |
|----|-----------------|
| 1  | Bachelor’s      |
| 2  | Master’s        |
| 3  | PhD             |

- **Ordinal Data**: Categorical data where the categories have a meaningful order or ranking.

- **Order Matters**: Categories can be ranked or ordered, but the differences between categories are not necessarily uniform.
- **Examples**:
  - **Education Levels**: High School, Bachelor’s, Master’s, PhD
  - **Customer Satisfaction**: Poor, Fair, Good, Excellent

::::



## A Simple Taxonomy of Data
### Numeric Data - Interval

:::: {.nonincremental}

| ID | Temperature (°F) |
|----|------------------|
| 1  | 70               |
| 2  | 80               |
| 3  | 90               |

- **Interval Data**: Numeric data where the differences between values are meaningful, but there is no true zero point.

- **Meaningful Intervals**: The difference between values is consistent.
- **No True Zero**: Zero does not indicate the absence of the quantity.
- **Examples**:
  - **Temperature (°F)**: Zero degrees does not mean no temperature.
  - **Time of Day in a 12-Hour Clock**: Differences are meaningful, but there is no absolute zero.

::::

## A Simple Taxonomy of Data
### Numeric Data - Ratio

:::: {.nonincremental}

| ID | Height (cm) | Weight (kg) |
|----|-------------|-------------|
| 1  | 160         | 55          |
| 2  | 175         | 70          |
| 3  | 170         | 65          |

- **Ratio Data**: Numeric data with a true zero point, allowing for a full range of mathematical operations.

- **Meaningful Ratios**: Comparisons like twice as much or half as much are valid.
- **True Zero**: Zero indicates the absence of the quantity.
- **Examples**:
  - **Height in Centimeters**: Zero means no height.
  - **Weight in Kilograms**: Zero means no weight.

# Challenges of Big Data {background-color="#1c4982"}


## Challenges of Big Data
### Information Overload

- **Difficulty in Finding Information**
  - **Search Challenges:** With so much data, traditional search methods become inefficient.
  - **Indexing Issues:** Properly cataloging data to make retrieval efficient is complex.
- **Trust Issues**
  - **Data Validity:** Users may question the accuracy and timeliness of available data.
  - **Source Credibility:** Differentiating between reliable and unreliable data sources.

## Challenges of Big Data
### Information Overload
- **Data from Diverse Sources**
  - **Integration Complexity:** Combining data from internal and external sources can be technically challenging.
  - **Data Formats:** Managing different data types, such as structured, unstructured, and semi-structured data.


## Challenges of Big Data
### Compliance and Regulations

- **Risk of Non-Compliance**
  - **Legal Penalties:** Organizations may face fines, sanctions, or legal action.
  - **Reputation Damage:** Public trust can be eroded by non-compliance incidents.
- **Impact on Organizations**
  - **Operational Costs:** Investing in compliance measures can be resource-intensive.
  - **Process Adjustments:** Policies and procedures may need significant changes to meet regulatory standards.
  

## Challenges of Big Data
### Compliance and Regulations
- **Need for Vigilance**
  - **Evolving Laws:** Regulations frequently update, requiring continuous monitoring.
  - **Employee Training:** Staff must be educated on compliance requirements and best practices.




## Challenges of Big Data
### Privacy Concerns

- **Data Harvesting**
  - **Collection Methods:** Corporations gather personal data through various means, often without explicit user consent.
  - **Scope of Data:** Information ranges from basic demographics to detailed behavioral patterns.
- **Extensive Profiling**
  - **User Tracking:** Monitoring online activities to build comprehensive profiles.
  - **Third-Party Sharing:** Data sold or shared with other organizations, amplifying privacy risks.
  

## Challenges of Big Data
### Privacy Concerns
- **Ethical Implications**
  - **Consent and Transparency:** Lack of clear communication about data usage.
  - **Right to Privacy:** Debates over how much personal data companies should access and store.
