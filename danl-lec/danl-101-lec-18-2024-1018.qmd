## Exploratory Data Analysis

<p align="center">
  <img src="https://bcdanl.github.io/lec_figs/data-science-explore.png">
</p>

- In data visualization, you'll turn data into plots.

- In data transformation, you'll learn the key verbs that allow you to select important variables, filter out key observations, create new variables, and compute summaries.

- In **exploratory data analysis**, you'll combine descriptive statistics (`skim()`), visualization, and transformation with your curiosity and skepticism to ask and answer interesting questions about data.





## Data visualization

> *"The simple graph has brought more information to the data analyst's mind than any other device."  John Tukey*

- Data visualization is the creation and study of the visual representation of data

- Many tools for visualizing data -- R is one of them

- Many approaches/systems within R for making data visualizations -- **ggplot2** is one of them, and that's what we're going to use



## Grammar of Graphics

<div style="text-align: center; width: 100%; margin: auto;">
  <img src="https://bcdanl.github.io/lec_figs/grammar-of-graphics.png" style="width: 75%; margin-bottom: -20px;">
  <p style="font-weight: bold;"></p>
</div>

- A **grammar of graphics** is a tool that enables us to concisely describe the components of a graphic.
  
## Data Visualization - First Steps

```{.r}
library(tidyverse)
mpg
?mpg
```

- The `mpg` data frame, provided by `ggplot2`, contains observations collected by the US Environmental Protection Agency on 38 models of car.

- Q. Do cars with big engines use more fuel than cars with small engines?
  - `displ`: a car's engine size, in liters.
  - `hwy`: a car's fuel efficiency on the highway, in miles per gallon (mpg). 


-  What does the relationship between engine size and fuel efficiency look like?


## Data Visualization - First Steps
### Creating a `ggplot`


```{r}
#| echo: true
#| fig-asp: .85
#| output-location: column-fragment

ggplot(data = mpg) + 
  geom_point(mapping = 
               aes(x = displ, 
                   y = hwy) )
```


- To plot `mpg`, run the above code to put `displ` on the `x`-axis and `hwy` on the `y`-axis.


## Data Visualization - First Steps
### Graphing Template

```{.r}
ggplot( data = DATA.FRAME ) + 
  GEOM_FUNCTION( mapping = 
                     aes( MAPPINGS ) )
```


- To make a ggplot plot, replace the capitalized components in the code above with a `data.frame`, a `geom` function, or a collection of mappings such as `x = variable_1` and `y = variable_2`.



# Aesthetic Mappings {background-color="#1c4982"}


## Aesthetic Mappings

<p align="center">
  <img src="https://bcdanl.github.io/lec_figs/r4s_330_1.png" width="600px">
</p>



- In the plot above, one group of points (highlighted in red) seems to fall outside of the linear trend. 

  - How can you explain these cars? Are those hybrids?



## Aesthetic Mappings


<p align="center">
  <img src="https://bcdanl.github.io/lec_figs/r4s_330_2.png" width="600px">
</p>

- An aesthetic is a visual property (e.g., `size`, `shape`, `color`) of the objects (e.g., `class`) in your plot.

- You can display a point in different ways by changing the values of its aesthetic properties. 

## Aesthetic Mappings
### Adding a `color` to the plot


```{r}
#| echo: true
#| fig-asp: .85
#| output-location: column-fragment

ggplot(data = mpg) + 
  geom_point(mapping = 
               aes(x = displ, 
                   y = hwy, 
                   color = class) )
```


## Aesthetic Mappings
### Adding a `shape` to the plot

```{r}
#| echo: true
#| fig-asp: .85
#| output-location: column-fragment


ggplot(data = mpg) + 
  geom_point(mapping = 
               aes(x = displ, 
                   y = hwy, 
                   shape = class) )
```




## Aesthetic Mappings
### Adding a `size` to the plot


```{r}
#| echo: true
#| fig-asp: .85
#| output-location: column-fragment

ggplot(data = mpg) + 
  geom_point(mapping = 
               aes(x = displ, 
                   y = hwy, 
                   size = class) )
```




## Aesthetic Mappings
### Adding an `alpha` (transparency) to the plot


```{r}
#| echo: true
#| fig-asp: .85
#| output-location: column-fragment

ggplot(data = mpg) + 
  geom_point(mapping = 
               aes(x = displ, 
                   y = hwy, 
                   alpha = class) )
```



## Aesthetic Mappings
### Overplotting problem

- Many points overlap each other. 
  - This problem is known as **overplotting**. 


- When points overlap, it's hard to know how many data points are at a particular location. 


- Overplotting can obscure patterns and outliers, leading to potentially misleading conclusions. 

- We can set a transparency level (`alpha`) between 0 (full transparency) and 1 (no transparency).


## Aesthetic Mappings
### Overplotting and `alpha`

```{r}
#| echo: true
#| fig-asp: .85
#| output-location: column-fragment


ggplot(data = mpg) + 
  geom_point(mapping = 
               aes(x = displ, 
                   y = hwy),
             alpha = .2)
```




## Aesthetic Mappings
### Specifying a `color` to the plot

```{r}
#| echo: true
#| fig-asp: .85
#| output-location: column-fragment
ggplot(data = mpg) + 
  geom_point(mapping = 
               aes(x = displ, 
                   y = hwy), 
             color = "blue")
```




## Aesthetic Mappings

<p align="center">
  <img src="https://bcdanl.github.io/lec_figs/r4s_330_3.png" width="600px">
</p>


- To set an aesthetic manually, set the aesthetic by name as an argument of your `geom_` function; i.e. it goes outside of `aes()`. 
  - You'll need to pick a level that makes sense for that aesthetic:
    - The name of a `color` as a *character string*.
    - The `size` of a point in *mm*.
    - The `shape` of a point as a *number*, as shown below.
  



## Common problems in `ggplot()`


```{.r}
ggplot(data = mpg) 
 + geom_point( mapping = 
                 aes(x = displ, 
                     y = hwy) )
```

- One common problem when creating `ggplot2` graphics is to put the `+` in the wrong place.
  - **Correct Approach**: Always place the `+` at the end of the previous line, not at the beginning of the next line.
