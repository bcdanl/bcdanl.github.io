# Question 1. Grouped summaries with `summarize()`

## Q1a.
- Brainstorm at least 5 different ways to assess the typical delay characteristics of a group of flights. Consider the following scenarios:
  
  - A flight is 15 minutes early 50% of the time, and 15 minutes late 50% of the time.

  - A flight is always 10 minutes late.

  - A flight is 30 minutes early 50% of the time, and 30 minutes late 50% of the time.

  - 99% of the time a flight is on time. 1% of the time itâ€™s 2 hours late.


- Which is more important: arrival delay or departure delay?
  
  

<br>
  
  
## Q1b. 

- Come up with another approach that will give you the same output as `not_cancelled` `%>%` `count(dest)` and `not_cancelled %>% count(tailnum, wt = distance)` (without using `count()`).

<br>

## Q1c.

- Our definition of cancelled flights (`is.na(dep_delay) | is.na(arr_delay)` ) is slightly suboptimal. Why? Which is the most important column?

<br>

## Q1d.
  
  - Look at the number of cancelled flights per day. Is there a pattern? Is the proportion of cancelled flights related to the average delay?
  

<br>

## Q1e.

  - Which carrier has the worst delays? Challenge: can you disentangle the effects of bad airports vs. bad carriers? Why/why not? (Hint: think about `flights %>% group_by(carrier, dest) %>% summarize(n())`)

<br>

## Q1f.

- What does the sort argument to `count()` do. When might you use it?


<br><br><br>
  
# Question 2. Grouped mutates (and filters)

## Q2a.

- Which plane (`tailnum`) has the worst on-time record?

<br>

## Q2b.
  
- What time of day should you fly if you want to avoid delays as much as possible?
  
<br>

## Q2c.
  
- For each destination, compute the total minutes of delay. For each flight, compute the proportion of the total delay for its destination.



<br>

## Q2d.
  
- Delays are typically temporally correlated: even once the problem that caused the initial delay has been resolved, later flights are delayed to allow earlier flights to leave. 

- Using `lag()`, explore how the delay of a flight is related to the delay of the immediately preceding flight.

<br>

## Q2e.
  
- Look at each destination. Can you find flights that are suspiciously fast? (i.e. flights that represent a potential data entry error). 

- Compute the air time of a flight relative to the shortest flight to that destination. Which flights were most delayed in the air?
  

<br>

## Q2f.
  
- Find all destinations that are flown by at least two carriers. Use that information to rank the carriers.

<br>

## Q2g.
  
- For each plane, count the number of flights before the first delay of greater than 1 hour.
