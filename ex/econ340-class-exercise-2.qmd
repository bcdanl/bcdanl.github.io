## Utility Maximization with the Cobb-Douglas utility function

The Cobb-Douglas utility function is

$$
\begin{align}
u(x_{1}, x_{2}) = x_{1}^{\alpha}x_{2}^{\beta}.
\end{align}
$$
Since utility functions are only defined up to a monotonic transformation ("more is better"), it is convenient to take logs of this expression and work with:

$$
\begin{align}
\log u(x_{1}, x_{2}) = \alpha \log x_{1} + \beta \log x_{2}.
\end{align}
$$


Letâ€™s find the demand functions for $x_1$ and $x_2$ for the Cobb-Douglas utility function. The problem we want to solve is

$$
\begin{align}
\max_{x_{1}, x_{2}}&\; \log u(x_{1}, x_{2}) = \alpha \log x_{1} + \beta \log x_{2} & (1)\\
\text{such that}&\quad Y \;\geq\; p_{1}x_{1} + p_{2}x_{2} 
\end{align}
$$

There are at least two ways to solve this problem. Since the more is the better for this consumer, the budget constraint holds with equality at the optimum. We can then substitute $x_{2}$ with $x_{1}$ using the budget constraint.

$$
\begin{align}
\max_{x_{1}}&\; \log u(x_{1}) = \alpha \log x_{1} + \beta \log \left(\frac{Y - p_{1}x_{1}}{p_{2}}\right) & (2)
\end{align}
$$
The first order condition for the problem (2) is

$$
\begin{align}
\frac{\alpha}{x_{1}} + \frac{\beta}{\left(\frac{Y - p_{1}x_{1}}{p_{2}}\right)}\left(-\frac{p_{1}}{p_{2}}\right) \,=\,& 0 & (3)
\end{align}
$$
Re-arranging (3) and the budget constraint give the demand for $x_{1}$ and $x_{2}$:

$$
\begin{align}
x_{1}^{*} = \frac{\alpha}{\alpha + \beta} \frac{Y}{p_{1}}\\
x_{2}^{*} = \frac{\beta}{\alpha + \beta} \frac{Y}{p_{2}}
\end{align}
$$
