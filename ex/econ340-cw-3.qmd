# Public Goods Game

The Public Goods Game is a standard of experimental economics used primarily to study the free-rider problem and cooperation among individuals. In this game, participants are given a sum of money and are offered the opportunity to contribute some or all of it to a public pot. The money in this pot is then multiplied by a factor greater than one but less than the number of players, and the resulting amount is distributed equally among all players, regardless of their individual contributions.

## Rules of the Public Goods Game:

1. **Initial Endowment**: Each player starts with an initial amount of money (e.g., $10).

2. **Contribution**: Players decide how much of their initial endowment to contribute to a public pot. They can contribute nothing, everything, or anything in between.

3. **Multiplication**: The total amount in the public pot is multiplied by a factor (e.g., 1.5).

4. **Distribution**: The multiplied amount is then equally distributed among all players, irrespective of their individual contributions.


## Example:

Let's consider a simple example with four players, each initially endowed with $10. They have to decide how much to contribute to a public pot.

1. **Player A contributes $8**
2. **Player B contributes $6**
3. **Player C contributes $0** (free-rider)
4. **Player D contributes $4**

The total amount in the public pot is \(8 + 6 + 0 + 4 = $18\).

This amount is then multiplied by a factor, say 1.5, resulting in \(18 \times 1.5 = $27\).

Finally, the $27 is distributed equally among the four players, giving each \(27 / 4 = $6.75\).

## Outcomes:

- **Player A**: Started with $10, contributed $8, received $6.75. Final amount: \(10 - 8 + 6.75 = $8.75\)
- **Player B**: Started with $10, contributed $6, received $6.75. Final amount: \(10 - 6 + 6.75 = $10.75\)
- **Player C**: Started with $10, contributed $0, received $6.75. Final amount: \(10 - 0 + 6.75 = $16.75\) (benefited most by free-riding)
- **Player D**: Started with $10, contributed $4, received $6.75. Final amount: \(10 - 4 + 6.75 = $12.75\)

## Insights:

1. **Free-Rider Problem**: Players like C who contribute nothing still receive a share of the public good, illustrating the free-rider problem.
  
2. **Incentive to Defect**: Rational, self-interested players have an incentive to contribute nothing and free-ride on the contributions of others.

3. **Collective Action Problem**: If everyone acts in their self-interest, the public good is under-provided, leading to suboptimal outcomes for the group.

4. **Cooperation and Norms**: In many real-world experiments, some level of contribution is observed, indicating that factors like altruism, social norms, or the prospect of future interactions can promote cooperation.

The Public Goods Game is a powerful tool for studying the complexities of cooperation and the provision of public goods, offering insights into how and why people contribute to collective endeavors.
