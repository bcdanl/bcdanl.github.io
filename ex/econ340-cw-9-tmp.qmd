# Taxing Labor and Pollution

Consider an economy with the representative consumer and the representative firm that produces a polluting good $Q$ with government that finances its budget $G$ by taxing on the consumer's labor income and the firm's pollution. 

The representative consumer is endowed with time $\overline{L}$, for which the consumer allocates to leisure ( $N$ ) and labor ( $\overline{L} - N$ ). The representative consumer gets paid with a wage rate $w$, and pays a proportional labor tax $m$.

The representative consumer values consumption of numeraire good $X$, polluting good $Q$ and leisure $N$, so that her utility function is:

$$
\begin{align}
U &= U(X, Q, N) \\
&= \left(\alpha Q - \beta\frac{Q^{2}}{2}\right) + \left(\gamma N - \phi\frac{N^{2}}{2}\right) + X.
\end{align}
$$

Note that if $\eta>0$, consumption of the polluting good and leisure are substitutes, which we refer to as the normal case. When $\eta<0$ leisure and the polluting good are complements.

The price of the polluting good $Q$ is $p$. The government transfer the tax revenue $G$ to the consumer in a lump-sum fashion. The representative consumer's budget constraint is:
$$
(1-m)w(\overline{L}-N) + G = X + pQ.
$$

The firm's cost of producing the quantity of output $Q$ is defined as
$$
C(Q) = \frac{c}{2}Q^{2}.
$$

The firm pays the per-unit tax $\tau$ on each unit of the goods produced.

The government tax revenue $G$ balances:

$$
G = wm(\overline{L} - N) + \tau Q.
$$

The external cost of pollution is 

$$
D(Q) = \frac{d}{2}Q^{2}
$$

# a.

Taking the price $p$, the wage $w$, and the labor tax $m$ as given, solve the consumer's utility maximization problem.

<br><br>

# b.

Taking the price $p$ and the per-unit pollution tax $\tau$ as given, solve the firm's profit maximization problem.

<br><br>


# c.

Taking the consumer's budget constraint, the government budget balance condition as given, solve the Social planner's welfare maximization problem.

  - Social welfare is the sum of the consumer's utility and the firm's profit minus the external cost.

<br><br>


# d.

- Using the first-order conditions in the consumer's utility maximization problem and the firm's profit maximization problem, characterize the equilibrium allocation $(Q^{*}, N^{*})$ and the equilibrium price $P$ in terms of exogenous parameters $(\alpha, \beta, c, d, w, \gamma, \phi)$ and tax rates $(m, \tau)$.

- How do the equilibrium levels of polluting good and leisure change with the pollution tax?
