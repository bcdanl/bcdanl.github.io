# Question 1.

Let's consider a Public Goods Game with deforestation.

## Context:

A village is located near a dense forest. The forest provides essential resources to the village, such as wood for fuel, fruits, and medicinal herbs. However, the forest also acts as a carbon sink, absorbing carbon dioxide and helping to regulate the climate. If too many trees are cut down, not only will the forest's resources be depleted, but the local climate may also become more unstable, leading to long-term consequences for the village.

## The Game:

1. **Players**: Each player represents a household in the village. Every household relies on the forest for resources but also understands the long-term benefits of conservation.

2. **Initial Endowment**: Each household starts with 100 units of currency.

3. **Decision**: Each round, households decide how many trees to cut down. Each tree cut down gives immediate benefits (e.g., 10 units of currency per tree). However, if the total number of trees cut by all households exceeds a certain threshold, the forest will degrade, leading to negative consequences for all players in subsequent rounds.

4. **Public Pot**: Instead of cutting trees, households can choose to contribute some of their currency to a public pot, which represents a community fund for forest conservation and sustainable resource management.

5. **Multiplication and Distribution**: At the end of each round, contributions to the public pot are used for reforestation and sustainable initiatives. For every unit of currency in the pot, the community fund plants new trees or invests in sustainable practices, multiplying the pot's value by a factor **1.5**. The benefits (like a stable climate, continued access to forest resources) are then equally distributed among all households, irrespective of individual contributions.


Suppose there are four households. In the first round:

1. **Household A** cuts 3 trees, earning 30 units.
2. **Household B** cuts 2 trees, earning 20 units, and contributes 20 units to the public pot.
3. **Household C** cuts 0 trees (choosing conservation) and contributes 50 units to the public pot.
4. **Household D** cuts 4 trees, earning 40 units.


### Q1a.
What is the total contribution to the public pot in the first round?

<br>


### Q1b.
How much units of 

<br>


### Q1c.


<br>


### Q1d.


<br>



The total contribution to the public pot is \(20 + 50 = 70\) units. This amount is multiplied by 1.5 (for reforestation efforts), resulting in 105 units of environmental benefit distributed equally among the households.

### Outcomes:

- If too many trees are cut collectively, the forest degrades, leading to reduced benefits in subsequent rounds.
- Households face the dilemma of gaining immediate benefits from cutting trees versus the long-term communal benefits of conservation.
- The game illustrates the tension between individual short-term gains and collective long-term benefits, mirroring real-world environmental challenges like deforestation, overfishing, and pollution.

This game can be used to study how communities balance immediate needs with long-term sustainability and the factors that influence cooperative behavior in environmental conservation.
