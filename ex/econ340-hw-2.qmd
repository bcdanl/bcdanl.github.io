# Question 1. Negative Externalities II
Consider a society with just two consumers. Consumer 1 can get positive utility from a positive amount of some activity $h$ that she chooses the level of, but consumer 2 gets negative utility from that activity. We can think of $h$ as some non-market good, for example, "hours" of loud music played by consumer 1, disturbing consumer 2's peace and quiet. Consumer 1 therefore imposes a negative externality on consumer 2. Assume there is no other cost associated with the activity.

Assume that both consumers gain utilities from consuming a numeraire good $x$, whose price is 1, but may have different incomes $Y_{1}$ and $Y_{2}$.

- Consumer 1's utility is $U_{1} = x_{1} + h(4-h)$.
- Consumer 2's utility is $U_{2} = x_{2} - h^{2}$.

## Q1e.
- Suppose that, instead of a tax or a subsidy, the government introduces a marketable-permit scheme. 
  - It gives consumer 2 a bunch of pieces of paper called "permits," each of which states that the holder of the permit has the legal right to "produce" one unit of $h$. 
  - It then allows consumer 2 to sell those permits to consumer 1 at some uniform price $p_{h}$. 


- Assume that the permit market is competitive.
  - This means that each consumer takes the price $p_{h}$ as given. 
  - You can think of each consumer as "representing" a large number of consumers of the same type.


- Show that the scheme will also achieve the socially optimal outcome $h^{o}$.

## Q1f.
- Same question as Q1e, but now the government introduces a marketable-permit scheme that gives a bunch of permits to consumer 1, and then gives consumer 2 an opportunity to buy them away from consumer 1 and "retire" them.

<br>

## Q1g.
- Suppose that, instead of trying to intervene in the market, the government just passes a law giving consumer 2 a clearly defined right to have $h = 0$ (e.g., it imposes a noise ordinance that forbids consumer 1 from playing loud music), but then allows consumer 1 to effectively "bribe" consumer 2 to give up some of that right (i.e., allow some music playing) in exchange for a lump-sum transfer $T$. 

- Show that this, too, will restore social optimality.

<br>

## Q1h.
- Same question as Q1g, but now the government gives consumer 1 a clear legal right to $h^{*}$ (i.e., in our example, a right to play as much loud music as she likes), and then allows consumer 2 to effectively "bribe" consumer 1 to give up some of that right (i.e., cut back on her music playing) in exchange for a lump-sum transfer $T$.
