# Question 1. Filling in Blanks, Short-answers, and Multiple Choices.


## Q1a.
Who will win or share Nobel Prize in Economic Science this year? 

**Answer:**

```{r}
knitr::include_graphics("goldin-nobel-2023.jpeg")
```

More details in Professor Goldin's contribution can be found here: [https://www.nobelprize.org/prizes/economic-sciences/2023/press-release/](https://www.nobelprize.org/prizes/economic-sciences/2023/press-release/).

<br><br>

## Q1b.

<p>  <u> Market goods </u> include tomatoes, VCRs and basketball shoes. <u>Nonmarket goods</u> include clean air, charitable deeds, and the view from a mountain top. </p>

<br><br>

## Q1c.

<p> Proponents of a <u>safety</u> standard argue that people have a right to protection from unsolicited damage to their health. </p>

<br><br>

## Q1d.

<p> Both sources and sinks make up <u>natural capital</u> : the inputs that nature provides for our production and consumption proccesses. </p>

<br><br>

## Q1e.

<p> Government regulation of pollution is one way of <u>internalizing</u> externalities. </p>


<br><br>

## Q1f.
What is the definition of Pareto efficieny?

**Answer:**

Pareto efficiency describes a situation in which it is impossible to make one person better off without making anyone else worse off.


<br><br>

## Q1g.
What does Coase Theorem says?

**Answer:**

If (1) polluter and victim can bargain costlessly, (2) property rights are well-defined, and (3) there is no free-riding, then private negotiation should arrive at the efficient outcome regardless of who has the initial right to pollute or prevent pollution.


<!-- - The implications of the Coase Theorem are profound: -->

<!--   - Private Solutions to Externalities: Even in the presence of externalities (unintended side effects of one party's actions on another), private parties can negotiate and arrive at efficient solutions without government intervention, as long as transaction costs are low. -->

<!--   - Importance of Clear Property Rights: For such negotiations to take place effectively, clear property rights must be established. It doesn't necessarily matter how these rights are allocated; what's important is that they are well-defined. -->

<!--   - Role of Transaction Costs: The theorem highlights the importance of transaction costs. If these costs are high, then private negotiations might not lead to efficient outcomes, and there might be a role for government intervention. -->

<br><br>

## Q1h.
What are the definitions of the willingness to pay (WTP) and the willingness to accept (WTA) for environmental quality?

**Answer:**

- WTP measures the monetary value one is willing to pay to attain improved quality, while maintaining the same level of utility experienced prior to the quality improvement. 

- WTA measures the monetary compensation one is willing to accept to forgo the improved quality, ensuring that the level of utility remains as what it would be with the quality improvement.

<br><br>

## Q1i.
A "tragedy of the commons" occurs for resources like the air that are commonly owned

a. because users weigh the full social costs against private
 benefits.
 
**b**. when there is free access to the resource.

c. when there is effective regulation of resource use.

d. when the population is small and stable.

e. because users internalize the negative externality associated with the resource use.



<br><br>

## Q1j.
<p> Economists use survey approaches for measuring the benefits of environmental protections called <u>contingent valuation</u>.  The four possible errors in these survey estimates are: <p> 

1.  <u>Hypothetical bias</u>
2.  <u>Free-riding</u>
3.  <u>Strategic bias</u>
4.  <u>Embedding bias</u>

# Question 2. Marginal Analysis
Suppose a factory produces goods under the private cost function 
$$
PC(Q) = \frac{1}{2}Q^{2} + Q
$$
where $Q$ and $PC(Q)$ are the quantity of output and the private total cost, respectively.

The factory is currently causing environmental pollution in the surrounding area. The external cost of this pollution is defined as:

$$
EC(Q) = 4Q
$$

Let $P$ be the price of the goods produced in the factory. The the demand curve for the goods is
$$
D(P) = 20 − 2P.
$$

## Q2a.
Draw curves for (1) demand, (2) marginal private cost, and (3) marginal social cost.

**Answer:**


Note that the demand curve is represented by the following inverse demand curve: 
$$
P(Q) = 10 - \frac{1}{2}Q.
$$

Since the time of Alfred Marshall, price has been represented on the y-axis and quantity on the x-axis.


The following functions describe curves for (1) marginal private cost (MPC) and (2) marginal social cost (MSC).

- MPC: $MPC(Q) = \frac{PC(Q)}{dQ} = Q + 1$
- MSC: $MSC(Q) = MPC + MEC = Q + 5$, where $MEC = \frac{dEC(Q)}{dQ} = 4$.

<!-- Therefore, the equilibrium point without internalizing the external cost is $E^{*}(Q^{*}, P^{*}) = (6, 7)$, and the equilibrium point with internalizing the external cost is $E(Q^{o}, P^{o}) = (3\frac{1}{3}, 8\frac{1}{3})$ -->


<br><br>

## Q2b.
What is the size of the social damage caused by the producer’s activity?

**Answer:**

Failing to internalize the external cost of pollution results in *overproduction*, which in turn reduces both consumer and producer surplus. This harm, in terms of lost welfare, is referred to as the deadweight loss (DWL). 

<!-- Overproducing $Q^{*} = \frac{10}{3}$ causes loss in producer surplus $\Delta ABD$. While the factory with interlizing the external cost  -->

<!-- The lower triangle of DWL measures the additional loss of producer surplus for those producers who have left the market and those who have stayed in the market but are producing more -->

The size of DWL caused by the overproduction is represented as the shaded triangle area $\Delta ABC$ below:

                               label = c("E*", "E", "A")),

```

- With no government intervention on pollution control, the equilibrium point is $A$, where $(Q^{*}, P^{*}) = (6,7)$.

- With internalizing the external cost, the equilibrium point is $B$, where $(Q^{o}, P^{o}) = \left(\frac{10}{3},\frac{25}{3}\right)$.


Therefore, $DWL = \Delta ABC$ is:

$$
\begin{align}
DWL &= \frac{1}{2}\times\left(6 - \frac{10}{3}\right)\times 4 \\
&= \frac{16}{3}.
\end{align}
$$

## Q2c.
- Let $T$ denote the tax levied on each unit of the goods produced, and the regulatory authority decides to internalize social damage by this Pigouvian tax scheme. 

  - Solve the optimal value for $T$.
  - How much is the tax revenue?


**Answer:**

The Pigouvian tax is set to the marginal external cost! Given that this cost is 4, the optimal tax rate $T$ is 4. Accordingly, the tax revenue is calculated as $4 \times \frac{10}{3} = \frac{40}{3}$.

Graphically, the Pigouvian tax shifts the firm's marginal private cost (MPC) curve upward by the amount of the tax rate $T$. After the tax, the MPC becomes equivalent to the MSC curve, achieving the socially optimal level of production $Q^{o}$.

Analytically, we can also derive the optimal tax by setting the firm's profit maximization problem with per-unit tax $T$. Taking the price $P$ as given, the firm solves the following problem:
$$
\begin{align}
\max_{Q}\,\Pi\,= \, P\times Q - PC(Q) - TQ\tag{Profit-max}
\end{align}
$$
Here the firm is a price taker. First-order condition for problem (Profit-max) is:
$$
\begin{align}
\frac{d\Pi}{dQ} &= P - MPC(Q) - T = 0 \tag{FOC-T}
\end{align}
$$
Since the optimal tax $T^{*}$ must induce the firm to produce $Q^{o} = \frac{10}{3}$, (FOC-T) implies that

$$
\begin{align}
T^{*} &= P(Q^{o}) - MPC(Q^{o})\\
&= 10 - \frac{1}{2}Q^{o} - (Q^{o} + 1)\\
&= 9 - \frac{3}{2}Q^{o}\\
&= 4.
\end{align}
$$

# Question 3. A Public Good Game

A community lives near a forest. The forest provides wood, which the villagers can use for various purposes like heating, building, or selling. However, the forest also acts as a carbon sink, absorbing carbon dioxide and providing fresh air, and is home to various wildlife. If too many trees are cut down, the forest will degrade, leading to loss of these environmental benefits.

There are $N$ number of people in the village. Each person is endowed with $\$y$, and must decide how much of their endowment to invest in a communal fund for forest conservation and how much to keep for themselves. Let $g_{i}$ denote each player's contribution to the communal fund. 

The total amount of dollars in the communial fund is multiplied by some constant factor $R$, where $1 < R < N$. The multiplied amount is then equally distributed among all players, irrespective of their individual contributions.

Each person $i$'s utility is as follows:
$$
\begin{align}
U_{i} &= y - g_{i} + \frac{R}{N} \times G\\
&= y - g_{i} + \frac{R}{N} \times \left(\, g_{i} + G_{-i} \,\right),
\end{align}
$$
where $G$ is the total amount of dollars collected for the communial fund, and $G_{-i} = G - g_{i}$.



## Q3a.
In equilibrium, how much would each individual contribute to the fund?

**Answer:**

Notice that each person $i$'s utility strictly decreases with $g_{i}$.

$$
\begin{align}
\frac{d U_{i}}{d g_{i}} = -1 + \frac{R}{N} < 0.\tag{FOC-i}
\end{align}
$$
Therefore, $g_{i}^{*} = 0$.

Implicitly, the constraint for $g_{i}$ is $0\leq g_{i} \leq y$.

<br><br><br>

## Q3b.
Under the efficiency standard, what is the social welfare function?

**Answer:**

Since all villagers are identical, the social welfare function is $N$ times $U_{i}$:

$$
\begin{align}
SW &= N \times U_{i}\qquad\text{ for any villager }\; i = 1, 2, \cdots, N\\
&= N \times \left(\,y - g_{i} + \frac{R}{N} \times G\,\right) \\
&= Ny +( R - 1 )\times G\\
&= Ny +( R - 1 )\times (G_{-i} + g_{i})\\
&= Ny +( R - 1 )\times (g_{1} + g_{2} + \cdots + g_{N})
\end{align}
$$


<br><br><br>

## Q3c.
What is the socially optimal level of $g_{i}$, for which the Social Planner chooses?

**Answer:**

Notice that the social welfare strictly increases with $g_{i}$. 

$$
\begin{align}
\frac{\partial SW}{\partial g_{i}} = R - 1 > 0.\tag{FOC-SP}
\end{align}
$$

Therefore, $g_{i}^{o} = y$.


Note that the above solution ignores the resource constraint the Social Planner faces:

$$
Ny\,\geq\, g_{1} + g_{2} + \cdots + g_{N} \,\geq\, 0.\tag{RC}
$$

If we take into account (RC), the solution is

$$
\left\{(g_{1}^{o}, g_{2}^{o}, \cdots, g_{N}^{o}) :  g_{1}^{o} + g_{2}^{o} + \cdots + g_{N}^{o} = Ny,\; g_{i}^{o} \geq 0 \text{ for all } i = 1, 2, \cdots, N. \right\}
$$
