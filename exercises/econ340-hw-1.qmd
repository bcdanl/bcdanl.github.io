## Question 1. Negative Externalities
Consider a situation with just two consumers. Consumer 1 gets positive utility from some activity $h$ that she chooses the level of, but consumer 2 gets negative utility from that activity. Think, for example, of $h$ as "hours" of loud music played by consumer 1, disturbing consumer 2's peace and quiet. Consumer 1 therefore imposes a negative externality on consumer 2. Assume there is no other cost associated with the activity. Assume also that both consumers get the same, additively separable utility from consumption of a numeraire good $x$, but may have different incomes $Y_{1}$ and $Y_{2}$.
