# Installing the Tools
### <p style="color:#00449E"> R programming </p>

The R language is available as a free download from the R Project website at:

- Windows: [https://cran.r-project.org/bin/windows/base/](https://cran.r-project.org/bin/windows/base/)
- Mac: [https://cran.r-project.org/bin/macosx/](https://cran.r-project.org/bin/macosx/)
  -  Download the file of R that corresponds to your Mac OS (Big Sur, Apple silicon arm64, High Sierra, El Capitan, Mavericks, etc.)


---
# Installing the Tools
### <p style="color:#00449E"> RStudio </p>

- **RStudio** offers a graphical interface to assist in creating R code:

  - The RStudio Desktop is available as a free download from the following webpage:
    - [https://www.rstudio.com/products/rstudio/download/#download](https://www.rstudio.com/products/rstudio/download/#download)

# Installing the Tools
### <p style="color:#00449E"> Excel </p>

- If you have not installed Microsoft Office on your computer, visit [software.geneseo.edu](https://wiki.geneseo.edu/display/cit/Software+at+Geneseo#SoftwareatGeneseo-MicrosoftOffice).
  - Download and install Microsoft Office from the software.geneseo.edu.

# Installing the Tools
### <p style="color:#00449E"> Anaconda </p>

- Anaconda is an all-in-one Python distribution.
  - Anaconda includes Python 3.x and its standard modules such as pip, pandas, matplotlib, etc.
  - Anaconda also includes several software applications of integrated development environment (IDE), which is a software for editing codes.
  - For the Python code, we will use **Spyder** IDE.  
    - Do not use RStudio from Anaconda, because RStudio from Anaconda is out-dated.

  
- To install Anaconda, go to the following download page:
  - [https://www.anaconda.com/products/distribution](https://www.anaconda.com/products/distribution).
  - Click the "Download" button.

# Installing the Tools
### <p style="color:#00449E"> Spyder IDE </p>

- If Spyder IDE from Anaconda is lagging, consider installing it additionally.
  
- To install Spyder IDE in addition to Anaconda, go to the following download page:
  - [https://www.spyder-ide.org](https://www.spyder-ide.org).
  - Click the "DOWNLOAD" menu.

# Management of Files, Directories, and Scripts
### <p style="color:#00449E"> Code and comment style </p>
- The two main principles for coding and managing data are:
  - Make things easier for your future self.
  - Don't trust your future self.

- The `#` mark is Spyder's comment character.
  - `#` indicates that the rest of the line is to be ignored.
  - Write comments before the line that you want the comment to apply to.

- Consider using block commenting for separating code sections.
  - `#%%` defines a coding block in Spyder.

- Break down long lines and long algebraic expressions.

# Working with Data from Files

- Step 1. Find the path name for the file, `car.data.csv`, from the sub-folder, 'UCICar', in the folder, 'PDSwR2-main'.

- Step 2. In the code below, replace 'PATH_NAME_FOR_THE_FILE_car.data.csv' with the path name for the file, `car.data.csv`.

- Step 3. Run the following Python code:

```{python, eval = F, echo = T}
import pandas as pd

path = 'PATH_NAME_FOR_THE_FILE_car.data.csv'

# reading data
uciCar = pd.read_csv(path)
```
