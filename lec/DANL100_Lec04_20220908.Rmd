# Tips on using Presentation Slides

<!-- ### <p style="color:#00449E"></p> -->

- To go to a previous/next page (or tab), use keyboard arrows, `r fa("arrow-left")` and `r fa("arrow-right")`.

- To see a tile view of the lecture slides, use the alphabet key, `o`.

- If we hover a mouse cursor on the code block, we can see and click the "Copy Code".

# Workflow
### <p style="color:#00449E"> Code and comment style </p>
- The two main principles for coding and managing data are:
  - Make things easier for your future self.
  - Don't trust your future self.


- The `#` mark is Spyder's comment character.
  - The `#` character has many names: `hash`, `sharp`, `pound`, or `octothorpe`.
  - `#` indicates that the rest of the line is to be ignored.
  - Write comments before the line that you want the comment to apply to.


- Consider using block commenting for separating code sections.
  - `#%%` defines a coding block in Spyder.

<!-- - Break down long lines and long algebraic expressions with backslash `\`. -->

# Data: Types, Values, Variables, and Names
### <p style="color:#00449E"> Python Data Are Objects </p>

- Python keeps track of where data are, and what (data type) they are.

- Python wraps each data value---booleans, integers, floats, strings, even large data structures, functions, and programs---in memory as an **object**.

- We can think of **objects** in Python programming as variable-sized boxes occupying spaces on memory shelves:

```{r, echo=FALSE, out.width = '23%', fig.align='center'}
knitr::include_graphics("../lec_figs/int-py-fig2-1.png")
```


---
# Data: Types, Values, Variables, and Names
### <p style="color:#00449E"> Python Data Are Objects </p>

- In Python, an object is a chunk of data that contains at least the following:

  - A **type** that defines what it can do, like a factory stamp on the box saying what it can do.
  
  - A **value** that is consistent with its type.
  
  - A *unique id* to distinguish it from other objects, like its location on the memory shelf.
  
  - A *reference count* that tracks how often this object is used.



---
# Data: Types, Values, Variables, and Names
### <p style="color:#00449E"> Python’s basic data types </p>


```{r, echo=FALSE, out.width = '57%', fig.align='center'}
knitr::include_graphics("../lec_figs/int-py-tab2-1.png")
```


- **Type** contains the Python name of that type. 
- **Mutable?** indicates whether the value can be changed after creation.




---
# Data: Types, Values, Variables, and Names
### <p style="color:#00449E"> Mutability </p>

- The type determines whether the data value contained by the box can be changed (mutable) or is constant (immutable).

  - A mutable object is like a box with a lid: not only can we see the value inside, we can also change it; 
  - However, we can’t change the type of an object.

```{python, eval = F, echo = T}
a = (1, 2, 3)     # tuple
a[0]
a[0] = 5
a
```
]
.pull-right[
```{python, eval = F, echo = T}
b = [1, 2, 3]     # list
b[0]
b[0] = 5
b
```
]




---
# Data: Types, Values, Variables, and Names
### <p style="color:#00449E"> Variables </p>

- Python lets you define **variables**---names for *values* in
your computer’s memory that you want to use in a program.
  
- Variable names can contain only these characters:
  - Lowercase letters (`a` through `z`)
  - Uppercase letters (`A` through `Z`)
  - Digits (`0` through `9`)
  - Underscore (`_`)
  - They are case-sensitive: `thing`, `Thing`, and `THING` are different names.
  - They must begin with a letter or an underscore, not a digit.
  - Names that begin with an underscore are treated specially.



---
# Data: Types, Values, Variables, and Names
### <p style="color:#00449E"> Variables </p>

- Variable names cannot be one of Python’s reserved words (also known as *keywords*):

```{r, echo=FALSE, out.width = '55%', fig.align='center'}
knitr::include_graphics("../lec_figs/int-py-ch2-reserved-words.png")
```

- Within a Python program, we can find the reserved words with:
```{python, eval = F, echo = T}
help("keywords")
```

### <p style="color:#00449E"> Variables </p>
.pull-left[
- Which names are valid?
  - `a`
  - `a1`
  - `a_b_c___95`
  - `_abc`
  - `_1a`
  - `1`
  - `1a`
  - `1_`
  - `name!`
  - `another-name`
]

.pull-right[
```{python, eval = F, echo = T}

```

# Data: Types, Values, Variables, and Names
### <p style="color:#00449E"> Assignment </p>

- In Python, we use `=` to assign a value to a variable.

```{python, eval = F, echo = T}
# Here we assign the integer value 5 to the variable x.
x = 5   

# Now we can use the variable x in the next line.
y = x + 12  
y
```

- In math, `=` means *equality* of both sides.
- In programs, `=` means **assignment**: *assign the value on the right side to the variable on the left side*.


---
# Data: Types, Values, Variables, and Names
### <p style="color:#00449E"> Assignment </p>


- In programs, everything on the right side needs to have a value.
  - The right side can be a literal value, or a variable that has already been assigned a value, or a combination.
  
- When Python reads `y = x + 12`, it does the following:
  - Sees the `=` in the middle.
  - Knows that this is an assignment.
  - Calculates the right side (gets the value of the object referred to by `x` and adds it to `12`).
  - Assigns the result to the left-side variable, `y`.






---
# Data: Types, Values, Variables, and Names
### <p style="color:#00449E"> Variables Are Names, Not Places </p>

- In Python, *variables* are just names.


```{r, echo=FALSE, out.width = '29%', fig.align='center', fig.cap="Names point to objects (variable `a` points to an integer object with value `7`)"}
knitr::include_graphics("../lec_figs/int-py-fig2-3.png")
```

---
# Data: Types, Values, Variables, and Names
### <p style="color:#00449E"> Variables Are Names, Not Places </p>

- If we want to print the value of anything (a variable (e.g., `x`, `y`) or a literal value (e.g., `5`, `12`, `abcd`)), we can use `print(thing)` or type `thing`. 

- If we want to know the type of anything, we can use `type(anything)`. 

- If we want to check whether a variable points to an object of a specific type, use `isinstance(type)`:

.pull-left[

```{python, eval = F, echo = T}
type(7)
isinstance(7, int)
a = 7
print(a)
b = a
```
]
.pull-right[

```{python, eval = F, echo = T}
type(a)
type(b)
type(50)
type(99.9)
type('abcd')
```
]



---
# Data: Types, Values, Variables, and Names
### <p style="color:#00449E"> Copying </p>

- Assignment does not copy a value; 
  - It just attaches a name to the object that contains the data.

- What value is *assigned* to variable `y` at the end of the following code?

```{python, eval = F, echo = T}
# Here we assign the integer value 5 to the variable x.
x = 5   

# Now we can use the variable x in the next line.
y = x + 12  
y

x = 8
```



---
# Data: Types, Values, Variables, and Names
### <p style="color:#00449E"> Copying </p>

- Assigning an existing variable `a` to a new variable named `b`
just makes `b` point to the same object that `a` does.

```{r, echo=FALSE, out.width = '29%', fig.align='center', fig.cap="Copying a name (now variable `b` also points to the same integer object)"}
knitr::include_graphics("../lec_figs/int-py-fig2-4.png")
```



---
# Data: Types, Values, Variables, and Names
### <p style="color:#00449E"> Copying </p>

- What value is *assigned* to variable `y` at the end of the following code?

```{python, eval = F, echo = T}
x = 5   
y = x 
x = 29
```



---
# Data: Types, Values, Variables, and Names
### <p style="color:#00449E"> Copying </p>

- A **list** is a *mutable* array of values.

- In the code below, `a` and `b` each points to a list with three integer members:

```{python, eval = F, echo = T}
a = [2, 4, 6]
b = a
a[1] = 0
```

- List members (`a[0]`, `a[1]`, and `a[2]`) are themselves like names, pointing to integer objects with the values 2, 4, and 6.

- If both names point to a mutable object, we can change the object’s value via either name, and we’ll see the changed value when we use either name.


---
# Data: Types, Values, Variables, and Names
### <p style="color:#00449E"> Choose Good Variable Names </p>

- It’s surprising how important it is to choose good names for your variables. 

- In many of the code examples so far, I’ve been using throwaway names like `a` and `x`. 

- In real programs, you’ll have many more variables to keep track of at once, and you’ll need to balance *brevity* and *clarity*. 

  - For example, it’s faster to type `num_loons` rather than `number_of_loons` or `blueberry_inventory`, but it’s more explanatory than `n`.



---
# Data: Types, Values, Variables, and Names
### <p style="color:#00449E"> Class Exercises </p>
1. Assign the integer value 33 to the variable `queen`, and print it.

2. What type is the value `3`?

3. What type is the value `3.0`?

4. What type is the expression `8 + 3.0`?

5. Modify the following line of code, so that a variable of string type data (`<class 'str'>`) is created.

```{python, eval = F, echo = T}
var_created = 1.5
print( "The data type of var_created is: ", type(var_created) )
```

# Numbers

- Let's look at the following Python’s simplest built-in data types in detail:

  - **Booleans** (which have the value `True` or `False`)
  
  - **Integers** (whole numbers such as `10` and `28`)
  
  - **Floats** (numbers with decimal points such as `3.141592`, or sometimes exponents like `1.0e8`, which means one times ten to the eighth power, or `100000000.0`)


---
# Numbers
### <p style="color:#00449E"> Booleans </p>

- The only values for the boolean data type are `True` and `False`.

- The special Python function `bool()` can convert any Python data
type to a boolean.
  - The `bool()` function takes any value as its argument and returns the boolean equivalent.
  
.pull-left[
```{python, eval = F, echo = T}
bool(True)
bool(1)
bool(4)
bool(-4)
```
]


.pull-right[
```{python, eval = F, echo = T}
bool(False)
bool(0)
bool(0.0)
```
]



---
# Numbers
### <p style="color:#00449E"> Integers </p>

- Any sequence of digits in Python represents *a literal integer*:

.pull-left[
- We can’t have an initial 0 followed by a digit between 1 and 9:
```{python, eval = F, echo = T}
0
01
```
]


.pull-right[
- We can’t have any commas as a digit separator in the integer.
- We can use the underscore (`_`) character as a digit separator
```{python, eval = F, echo = T}
1,000,000   # We get a tuple!
billion = 1_000_000_000
billion
3_2_1
```

]


---
# Numbers
### <p style="color:#00449E"> Integer Operations </p>

.pull-left[
- Python can be a simple calculator.

- Here is a table of the math operators:

```{r, echo=FALSE, out.width = '100%', fig.align='center'}
knitr::include_graphics("../lec_figs/int-py-ch3-operation.png")
```

]
.pull-right[
- Dividing by zero with either kind of division causes a Python exception

```{python, eval = F, echo = T}
12 + 8
12 - 8
13 * 1.2
2 + 3 * 4
2 ** 3
2 / 0
2 // 0
```
]


---
# Numbers
### <p style="color:#00449E"> Integers and Variables </p>

- In Python, the expression on the right side of the `=` is calculated first, and then assigned to the variable on the left side.


.pull-left[
- Subtract `2` from `a`.
- Assign the result of that subtraction to a temporary variable, `tmp`.
- Assign the value of the temporary variable to `a`.

]
.pull-right[

```{python, eval = F, echo = T}
a = 72
tmp = a - 2
a = tmp
```
]


---
# Numbers
### <p style="color:#00449E"> Integers and Variables </p>

- We can combine the arithmetic operators with assignment by putting the operator before the `=`.


.pull-left[
```{python, eval = F, echo = T}
a = 72
a -= 2   # This is like a = a - 2
```

]

.pull-right[
```{python, eval = F, echo = T}
b = 62
b += 2    # This is like b = b + 2
```
]

.pull-left[
```{python, eval = F, echo = T}
c = 72
c *= 2   # This is like c = c * 2
```

]

.pull-right[
```{python, eval = F, echo = T}
d = 62
d /= 2    # This is like d = d / 2
```

]



---
# Numbers
### <p style="color:#00449E"> Type Conversions </p>

- To change other Python data types to an integer, use the `int()` function.
  - `int()` keeps the whole number and discard any fractional part.

- `True` and `False` are converted to integer values `1` and `0`.

.pull-left[
```{python, eval = F, echo = T}
int(True)
int(False)
```

]

.pull-right[
```{python, eval = F, echo = T}
bool(1)
bool(0)
```
]

.pull-left[
```{python, eval = F, echo = T}
int(72.3)
int(1.0e4)
```

]

.pull-right[
```{python, eval = F, echo = T}
bool(1.0)
bool(0.0)
```

]



---
# Numbers
### <p style="color:#00449E"> Floats </p>

- Integers are whole numbers, but floating-point numbers (called **floats** in Python) have decimal points:


.pull-left[
```{python, eval = F, echo = T}
4.
4.0
04.0
```

]

.pull-right[
```{python, eval = F, echo = T}
4e0
4e1
4.0e1
4.0 * (10 ** 1)
```
]

---
# Numbers
### <p style="color:#00449E"> Floats </p>

- To convert other types to floats, we use the `float()` function.

.pull-left[
```{python, eval = F, echo = T}
float(True)
float(False)
```

]

.pull-right[
```{python, eval = F, echo = T}
float(88)
float('89')
```
]

# Numbers
### <p style="color:#00449E"> Class Exercises </p>
1. Multiply the number of seconds in a minute (`60`) by the number of minutes in an hour (also `60`) using Python.

2. Assign the result from the previous task (seconds in an hour) to a variable called `seconds_per_hour`.

3. How many seconds are in a day? Use your `seconds_per_hour` variable.

4. Calculate seconds per day again, but this time save the result in a variable called `seconds_per_day`

5. Divide `seconds_per_day` by `seconds_per_hour`. Use floating-point (`/`) division.
