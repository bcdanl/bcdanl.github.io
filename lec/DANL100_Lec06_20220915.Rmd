### <p style="color:#00449E"> Code and comment style </p>
- The two main principles for coding and managing data are:
  - Make things easier for your future self.
  - Don't trust your future self.


- The `#` mark is Spyder's comment character.
  - The `#` character has many names: `hash`, `sharp`, `pound`, or `octothorpe`.
  - `#` indicates that the rest of the line is to be ignored.
  - Write comments before the line that you want the comment to apply to.


- Consider using block commenting for separating code sections.
  - `# %%` defines a coding block in Spyder.

<!-- - Break down long lines and long algebraic expressions with backslash `\`. -->

# Numbers

- Let's look at the following Python’s simplest built-in data types in detail:

  - **Booleans** (which have the value `True` or `False`)
  
  - **Integers** (whole numbers such as `10` and `28`)
  
  - **Floats** (numbers with decimal points such as `3.141592`, or sometimes exponents like `1.0e8`, which means one times ten to the eighth power, or `100000000.0`)

- Python can be a simple calculator.

- Here is a table of the math operators:

```{r, echo=FALSE, out.width = '95%', fig.align='center'}
knitr::include_graphics("../lec_figs/int-py-ch3-operation.png")
```

]
.pull-right[
- Dividing by zero with either kind of division causes a Python exception

```{python, eval = F, echo = T}
12 + 8
12 - 8
13 * 1.2
2 + 3 * 4
2 ** 3
2 / 0
2 // 0
```
]



---
# Numbers
### <p style="color:#00449E"> Integers and Variables </p>

- We can combine the arithmetic operators with assignment by putting the operator before the `=`.


.pull-left[
```{python, eval = F, echo = T}
a = 72
a -= 2   # This is like a = a - 2
```

]

.pull-right[
```{python, eval = F, echo = T}
b = 62
b += 2    # This is like b = b + 2
```
]

.pull-left[
```{python, eval = F, echo = T}
c = 72
c *= 2   # This is like c = c * 2
```

]

.pull-right[
```{python, eval = F, echo = T}
d = 62
d /= 2    # This is like d = d / 2
```

]



---
# Numbers
### <p style="color:#00449E"> Type Conversions </p>

- To change other Python data types to an integer, use the `int()` function.
  - `int()` keeps the whole number and discard any fractional part.

- `True` and `False` are converted to integer values `1` and `0`.

.pull-left[
```{python, eval = F, echo = T}
int(True)
int(False)
```

]

.pull-right[
```{python, eval = F, echo = T}
bool(1)
bool(0)
```
]

.pull-left[
```{python, eval = F, echo = T}
int(72.3)
int(1.0e4)
```

]

.pull-right[
```{python, eval = F, echo = T}
bool(1.0)
bool(0.0)
```

]




---
# Numbers
### <p style="color:#00449E"> Floats </p>

- To convert other types to floats, we use the `float()` function.

.pull-left[
```{python, eval = F, echo = T}
float(True)
float(False)
```

]

.pull-right[
```{python, eval = F, echo = T}
float(88)
float('89')
```
]

]

.panel[.panel-name[Without `\`]
```{python, eval = F, echo = T}

.panel[.panel-name[With `()`]
- If you’re in the middle of paired parentheses (or square or curly brackets), Python doesn’t squawk about line endings:

```{python, eval = F, echo = T}
sum = ( 1 +  
        2 +  
        3 +
        4 )

### <p style="color:#00449E"> Class Exercises </p>
1. Multiply the number of seconds in a minute (`60`) by the number of minutes in an hour (also `60`) using Python.

2. Assign the result from the previous task (seconds in an hour) to a variable called `seconds_per_hour`.

3. How many seconds are in a day? Use your `seconds_per_hour` variable.

4. Calculate seconds per day again, but this time save the result in a variable called `seconds_per_day`

5. Divide `seconds_per_day` by `seconds_per_hour`. Use floating-point (`/`) division.

# Choose with `if`
### <p style="color:#00449E"> Compare with `if`, `elif`, and `else` </p>

- Now, we finally take our first step into the *code structures* that weave data into programs.

- The following Python program checks the value of the boolean variable `disaster` and prints an appropriate comment:

```{python, eval = F, echo = T}
disaster = True
if disaster:
    print("Woe!")
else:
    print("Whee!")
```


---
# Choose with `if`
### <p style="color:#00449E"> Compare with `if`, `elif`, and `else` </p>

- The `if` and `else` lines are Python *statements* that check whether a condition is a boolean `True` value, or can be evaluated as `True`.

```{python, eval = F, echo = T}
disaster = True
if disaster:
    print("Woe!")
else:
    print("Whee!")
```


---
# Choose with `if`
### <p style="color:#00449E"> Compare with `if`, `elif`, and `else` </p>

- Python expects you to be consistent with code within a section—the lines need to be indented the same amount, lined up on the left.

  - The recommended style is to use *four* spaces.
  - When changing a line by hitting the key *enter/return*, Spyder takes care of indention pretty well.
  
```{python, eval = F, echo = T}
disaster = True
if disaster:
    print("Woe!")
else:
    print("Whee!")
```



---
# Choose with `if`
### <p style="color:#00449E"> Compare with `if`, `elif`, and `else` </p>

- We did a number of things here:
```{python, eval = F, echo = T}
disaster = True
if disaster:
    print("Woe!")
else:
    print("Whee!")
```

  - Assigned the boolean value `True` to the variable named `disaster`.
  - Performed a conditional comparison by using `if` and `else`, executing different code depending on the value of `disaster`.
  - Called the `print()` function to print some text.



---
# Choose with `if`
### <p style="color:#00449E"> Compare with `if`, `elif`, and `else` </p>

- We can have tests within tests, as many levels deep as needed:
```{python, eval = F, echo = T}
furry = True
large = True
if furry:
    if large:
        print("It's a yeti.")
    else:
        print("It's a cat!")
else:
    if large:
        print("It's a whale!")
    else:
        print("It's a human. Or a hairless cat.")
```




---
# Choose with `if`
### <p style="color:#00449E"> Compare with `if`, `elif`, and `else` </p>

- Indentation determines how the `if` and `else` sections are paired.
```{python, eval = F, echo = T}
furry = True
large = True
if furry:
    if large:
        print("It's a yeti.")
    else:
        print("It's a cat!")
else:
    if large:
        print("It's a whale!")
    else:
        print("It's a human. Or a hairless cat.")
```




---
# Choose with `if`
### <p style="color:#00449E"> Compare with `if`, `elif`, and `else` </p>

If there are more than two possibilities to test, use `if` for the first, `elif` (meaning *else if*) for the middle ones, and `else` for the last:
```{python, eval = F, echo = T}
color = "mauve"
if color == "red":
    print("It's a rasberry")
elif color == "green":
    print("It's a green chili")
elif color == "bee purple":
    print("I don't know what it is, but only bees can see it")
else:
    print("I've never heard of the color", color)
```



---
# Choose with `if`
### <p style="color:#00449E"> Comparison Operators </p>

- Here are Python's comparison operators:

```{r, echo=FALSE, out.width = '24%', fig.align='center'}
knitr::include_graphics("../lec_figs/int-py-ch4-comparison.png")
```



---
# Choose with `if`
### <p style="color:#00449E"> Comparison Operators </p>

- Here are Python's comparison operators:

```{python, eval = F, echo = T}
# Assign x to 7
x = 7

x == 5    # Test equality
x == 7
5 < x
x < 10
```




---
# Choose with `if`
### <p style="color:#00449E"> Comparison Operators </p>

- Logical operators have lower *precedence* than the chunks of code that they’re comparing.

  -  This means that the chunks are calculated first, and then compared.


```{python, eval = F, echo = T}
5 < x and x < 10
```

- The easiest way to avoid confusion about *precedence* is to add parentheses

```{python, eval = F, echo = T}
(5 < x) and (x < 10)
```


---
# Choose with `if`
### <p style="color:#00449E"> Comparison Operators </p>

- Here are some other tests:
```{python, eval = F, echo = T}
5 < x or x < 10
5 < x and x > 10
5 < x and not x > 10
```

- If you’re `and`-ing multiple comparisons with one variable, Python lets you do this:
```{python, eval = F, echo = T}
5 < x < 10      # It’s the same as 5 < x and x < 10
```




---
# Choose with `if`
### <p style="color:#00449E"> What Is `True`? </p>

- What does Python consider `True` and `False`?


- A `False` value doesn’t necessarily need to explicitly be a boolean `False`. 
  - The followings are all considered `False`:
  
.pull-left[
```{r, echo=FALSE, out.width = '36%', fig.align='center'}
knitr::include_graphics("../lec_figs/int-py-ch4-false1.png")
```
]
.pull-right[
```{r, echo=FALSE, out.width = '36%', fig.align='center'}
knitr::include_graphics("../lec_figs/int-py-ch4-false2.png")
```
]



- Anything else is considered `True`.


---
# Choose with `if`
### <p style="color:#00449E"> What Is `True`? </p>
- Python programs use these definitions of "truthiness" and "falsiness" to check for empty data structures as well as `False` conditions:

```{python, eval = F, echo = T}
some_list = []
if some_list:
    print("There's something in here")
else:
    print("Hey, it's empty!")
```


---
# Choose with `if`
### <p style="color:#00449E"> Do Multiple Comparisons with `in` </p>
- Suppose that you have a letter and want to know whether it’s a vowel. 
  - One way would be to write a long `if` statement:
  
```{python, eval = F, echo = T}
letter = 'o'
if letter == 'a' or letter == 'e' or letter == 'i' \
    or letter == 'o' or letter == 'u':
    print(letter, 'is a vowel')
else:
    print(letter, 'is not a vowel')
```



---
# Choose with `if`
### <p style="color:#00449E"> Do Multiple Comparisons with `in` </p>
- Whenever you need to make a lot of comparisons like that, separated by or, use Python’s *membership operator* `in`, instead.
  
```{python, eval = F, echo = T}
vowels = 'aeiou'
letter = 'o'

letter in vowels

if letter in vowels:
    print(letter, 'is a vowel')
```


---
# Choose with `if`
### <p style="color:#00449E"> Do Multiple Comparisons with `in` </p>
- Here are some examples of how to use `in` with some data types:

.panelset[

.panel[.panel-name[Set]
```{python, eval = F, echo = T}
letter = 'o'
vowel_set = {'a', 'e', 'i', 'o', 'u'}
letter in vowel_set
```
]

.panel[.panel-name[List]
```{python, eval = F, echo = T}
vowel_list = ['a', 'e', 'i', 'o', 'u']
letter in vowel_list
```
]

.panel[.panel-name[Tuple]
```{python, eval = F, echo = T}
vowel_tuple = ('a', 'e', 'i', 'o', 'u')
letter in vowel_tuple
```
]

.panel[.panel-name[Dictionary]
```{python, eval = F, echo = T}
vowel_dict = {'a': 'apple', 'e': 'elephant',
              'i': 'impala', 'o': 'ocelot', 
              'u': 'unicorn'}
letter in vowel_dict
```
- For the dictionary, `in` looks at the keys (the left-hand side of the `:`) instead of their values.
]

.panel[.panel-name[String]
```{python, eval = F, echo = T}
vowel_string = "aeiou"
letter in vowel_string
```
]

]

# Choose with `if`
### <p style="color:#00449E"> Walrus Operator </p>

- The *walrus operator* looks like this:

```{r, echo=FALSE, out.width = '24%', fig.align='center'}
knitr::include_graphics("../lec_figs/int-py-ch5-walrus.png")
```


.panelset[

.panel[.panel-name[Two-step assignments]
```{python, eval = F, echo = T}
tweet_limit = 280
tweet_string = "Blah" * 50
diff = tweet_limit - len(tweet_string)
if diff >= 0:
    print("A fitting tweet")
else:
    print("Went over by", abs(diff))
```
]

.panel[.panel-name[Walrus]
```{python, eval = F, echo = T}
tweet_limit = 280
tweet_string = "Blah" * 50
if ( diff := tweet_limit - len(tweet_string) ) >= 0:
    print("A fitting tweet")
else:
    print("Went over by", abs(diff))
```
]


]

# Choose with `if`
### <p style="color:#00449E"> Class Exercises </p>
1. Choose a number between 1 and 10 and assign it to the variable `secret`. Then, select another number between 1 and 10 and assign it to the variable `guess`. Next, write the conditional tests (`if`, `else`, and `elif`) to print the string '`too low`' if `guess` is less than `secret`, '`too high`' if greater than `secret`, and '`just right`' if equal to `secret`.

2. Assign `True` or `False` to the variables `small` and `green`. Write some `if`/`else` statements to print which of these matches those choices: `cherry`, `pea`, `watermelon`, `pumpkin`.
