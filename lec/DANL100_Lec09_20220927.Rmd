# Loop with `while` and `for`

# Loop with `while` and `for`

- Sometimes, we need to do something more than once. 
  - We need a loop, and Python gives us two choices: `while` and `for`.
  
### <p style="color:#00449E"> Repeat with `while` </p>

<!-- - Try the following example: -->

```{python, eval = F, echo = T}
count = 1        
while count <= 5:
    print(count)
    count += 1
```

.panelset[
.panel[.panel-name[Step 1.]
- We first assigned the value 1 to `count`.
]

.panel[.panel-name[Step 2.]
- The `while` loop compared the value of `count` to 5 and continued if `count` was less than or equal to 5.
]

.panel[.panel-name[Step 3.]
- Inside the loop, we printed the value of `count` and then *incremented* its value by one with the statement `count += 1`.
]

.panel[.panel-name[Step 4.]
- Python goes back to the top of the loop, and again compares `count` with 5.
]

.panel[.panel-name[Step 5.]
- The value of `count` is now 2, so the contents of the `while` loop are again executed, and `count` is incremented to 3.
]

.panel[.panel-name[Step 6.]
- This continues until `count` is incremented from 5 to 6 at the bottom of the loop.
]

.panel[.panel-name[Step 7.]
- On the next trip to the top, `count <= 5` is now `False`, and the `while` loop ends.
]

]


---
# Repeat with `while`
### <p style="color:#00449E"> Asking the user for input </p>

- Sometimes we would like to take the value for a variable from the user via their keyboard. 
  - The `input()` function gets *input* from the keyboard.
  - When the `input()` is called, the program stops and waits for the user to type something on Console (interactive Python interpreter).
  - When the user presses **Return** or **Enter** on Console, the program resumes and input returns what the user typed as a string.
  
```{python, eval = F, echo = T}
stuff = input()
# Type something and press Return/Enter on Console 
# before running print(stuff)
print(stuff)
```


---
# Repeat with `while`
### <p style="color:#00449E"> Cancel with `break` </p>

- `While` loop is used to execute a block of code repeatedly until given boolean condition evaluated to `False`. 
  - `while True` loop will run forever unless we write it with a `break` statement.


- If we want to loop until something occurs, but we’re not sure when that might happen, we can use an infinite loop with a `break` statement. 

```{python, eval = F, echo = T}
while True:
    stuff = input("String to capitalize [type q to quit]: ")
    if stuff == "q":
        break
    print(stuff.capitalize())
```


---
# Repeat with `while`
### <p style="color:#00449E"> Skip Ahead with `continue` </p>

- Sometimes, we don’t want to break out of a loop but just want to skip ahead to the
next iteration for some reason. 

- The `continue` statement is used to skip the rest of the code inside a loop for the *current iteration* only. 
  <!-- - Loop does not terminate but *continues* on with the next iteration. -->

<!-- - The `pass` statement in Python is used when a statement is required syntactically but you do not want any command or code to execute. -->


```{python, eval = F, echo = T}
while True:
    value = input("Integer, please [q to quit]: ")
    if value == 'q': # quit
        break
    number = int(value)
    if number % 2 == 0: # an even number
        continue
    print(number, "squared is", number*number)
```



---
# Repeat with `while`
### <p style="color:#00449E"> Check `break` Use with `else` </p>

- We can consider using `while` with `else` when we’ve coded a `while` loop to check for something, and `break`ing as soon as it’s found. 
  <!-- - The `else` would be run if the `while` loop completed but the object was not found. -->
  
```{python, eval = F, echo = T}
numbers = [1, 3, 5]
position = 0
while position < len(numbers):
    number = numbers[position]
    if number % 2 == 0:
        print('Found even number', number)
        break
    position += 1
else: # break not called
    print('No even number found')
```
- Consider it a break checker.



---
# Loop with `while` and `for`
### <p style="color:#00449E"> Iterate with `for` and `in` </p>

- Sometimes we want to loop through a set of things such as a string of text, a list of words or a list of numbers.

  - When we have a list of things to loop through, we can construct a `for` loop. 

  - A `for` loop makes it possible for you to traverse data structures without knowing how large they are or how they are implemented. 
  
  <!-- - We can iterate over data that is created on the fly, allowing processing of data streams that would otherwise not fit in the computer’s memory all at once. -->


<!-- - To do iteration, we need something like *strings*, *lists* and *tuples* or *dictionaries* to iterate over.  -->



---
# Loop with `while` and `for`
### <p style="color:#00449E"> Iterate with `for` and `in` </p>

- Let's see two ways to walk through a string here:

.pull-left[
```{python, eval = F, echo = T}
word = 'thud'
offset = 0
while offset < len(word):
    print(word[offset])
    offset += 1
```
]
.pull-right[
```{python, eval = F, echo = T}
word = 'thud'
for letter in word:
    print(letter)
```
]

- Which one do you prefer?

---
# Iterate with `for` and `in`


.pull-left[
### <p style="color:#00449E"> Cancel with `break` </p>
- A `break` in a `for` loop breaks out of the loop, as it does for a `while` loop:

```{python, eval = F, echo = T}
word = 'thud'
for letter in word:
    if letter == 'u':
        break
    print(letter)
```
]

.pull-right[
### <p style="color:#00449E"> Skip with `continue` </p>
- Inserting a `continue` in a `for` loop jumps to the next iteration of the loop, as it does
for a `while` loop.

```{python, eval = F, echo = T}
word = 'thud'
for letter in word:
    if letter == 'u':
        continue
    print(letter)
```
]



---
# Iterate with `for` and `in`
### <p style="color:#00449E"> Check `break` Use with `else` </p>
- Similar to `while`, `for` has an optional `else` that checks whether the `for` completed
normally. If `break` was not called, the `else` statement is run.

  - This is useful when we want to verify that the previous `for` loop ran to completion instead of being stopped early with a `break`:

```{python, eval = F, echo = T}
word = 'thud'
for letter in word:
    if letter == 'x':
        print("Eek! An 'x'!")
        break
    print(letter)
else:
    print("No 'x' in there.")
```

<!-- - It makes more sense if we think of the `for` as looking for something, and `else` being called if we didn’t find it.  -->
<!--   - To get the same effect without `else`, we can use some variable to indicate whether we found what we wanted in the `for` loop. -->


---
# Iterate with `for` and `in`
### <p style="color:#00449E"> Generate Number Sequences with `range()` </p>

.panelset[
.panel[.panel-name[Why `range()`?]
- The `range()` function returns a stream of numbers within a specified range, without
first having to create and store a large data structure such as a *list* or *tuple*. 

  - This lets us create huge ranges without using all the memory in our computers and crashing our program.
  
  - `range()` returns an iterable object, so we need to step through the values with `for` ... `in`, or convert the object to a sequence like a *list*. 


]

.panel[.panel-name[`for` ... `in` `range()`]
- We use `range()` similar to how we use *slices*: `range( start, stop, step )`. 
  - If we omit `start`, the `range` begins at 0. 
  - The only required value is `stop`; as with *slices*, the last value created will be just before stop. 
  - The default value of `step` is 1, but we can change it.

```{python, eval = F, echo = T}
for x in range(0, 3):
    print(x)
list( range(0, 3) )
```

]



.panel[.panel-name[step < 0]
- How can we make a range from 2 down to 0?

```{python, eval = F, echo = T}
for x in range(2, -1, -1):
    print(x)
    
list( range(2, -1, -1) )
```

]



.panel[.panel-name[step > 1]
- How can we get only even numbers?

```{python, eval = F, echo = T}
for x in range(0, 11, 2):
    print(x)
    
list( range(0, 11, 2) )
```

]

]

# Loop with `while` and `for`
### <p style="color:#00449E"> Class Exercises </p>

.panelset[
.panel[.panel-name[`while` loop]

1. Use a `while` loop to print the values of the list [3, 2, 1, 0].

2. Assign the value 7 to the variable `guess_me`, and the value 1 to the variable `number`. Write a `while` loop that compares `number` with `guess_me.` Print 'too low' if `number` is less than guess me. If `number` equals `guess_me`, print 'found it!' and then exit the loop. If `number` is greater than `guess_me`, print 'oops' and then exit the loop. Increment `number` at the end of the loop.


]


.panel[.panel-name[`for` loop]

1. Use a `for` loop to print the values of the list [3, 2, 1, 0].

2. Assign the value 5 to the variable `guess_me.` Use a `for` loop to iterate a variable called `number` over `range(10)`. If `number` is less than `guess_me`, print 'too low'. If `number` equals `guess_me`, print 'found it!' and then `break` out of the `for` loop. If `number` is greater than `guess_me`, print 'oops' and then exit the loop.

# Tuples and Lists
### <p style="color:#00449E">  </p>

- In the previous classes, we started with some of Python’s basic data types: booleans,
integers, floats, and strings. 
  
  - If we think of those as atoms, the data structures in tuples and lists are like molecules.
  

- Like strings, tuples and lists have a sequence structures indexed by their integer position.
  

- Unlike strings, the elements in tuples and lists can be of different types.
  

- Why does Python contain both lists and tuples? 

  - Tuples are immutable; when we assign elements (only once) to a tuple, they’re baked in the cake and can’t be changed.

  - Lists are mutable, meaning we can insert and delete elements with great enthusiasm.




---
# Tuples
### <p style="color:#00449E"> Create with Commas and () </p>

- The syntax to make tuples is a little inconsistent.

.panelset[
.panel[.panel-name[(1)]
- Let's begin by making an empty tuple using ():
```{python, eval = F, echo = T}
empty_tuple = ()
```

]

.panel[.panel-name[(2)]
- To make a tuple with one or more elements, follow each element with a comma. 
  - This works for one-element tuples:
```{python, eval = F, echo = T}
one_geneseo = 'Geneseo',
```

]

.panel[.panel-name[(3)]
- We could enclose them in parentheses and still get the same tuple:
```{python, eval = F, echo = T}
one_geneseo = ('Geneseo',)
```
]

.panel[.panel-name[(4)]
- If we have a single thing in parentheses and omit that comma, we would not get a tuple, but just the thing.
```{python, eval = F, echo = T}
one_geneseo = ('Geneseo')
```
]

.panel[.panel-name[(5)]
- If we have more than one element, follow all but the last one with a comma:
```{python, eval = F, echo = T}
suny_tuple = 'Geneseo', 'Borckport', 'Oswego'
```
]

.panel[.panel-name[(6)]
- We often don’t need parentheses when we define a tuple, but using parentheses is a little safer, and it helps to make the tuple more visible:
```{python, eval = F, echo = T}
suny_tuple = ('Geneseo', 'Borckport', 'Oswego')
```
]


.panel[.panel-name[(7)]
- We do need the parentheses for cases in which commas might also have another use.
```{python, eval = F, echo = T}
one_geneseo = 'Geneseo',
type(one_geneseo)

type('Groucho',)
type(('Groucho',))
```

]

.panel[.panel-name[(8)]
- Tuples let us assign multiple variables at once:
```{python, eval = F, echo = T}
suny_tuple = ('Geneseo', 'Borckport', 'Oswego')
a, b, c = suny_tuple
a
b
c
```

  - This is sometimes called *tuple unpacking*.

]

.panel[.panel-name[(9)]
- We can use tuples to exchange values in one statement without using a temporary
variable:
```{python, eval = F, echo = T}
password = 'swordfish'
icecream = 'tuttifrutti'
password, icecream = icecream, password

password
icecream
```

]


]



---
# Tuples
### <p style="color:#00449E">  </p>


.panelset[
.panel[.panel-name[`tuple()`]
### Create with `tuple()`
- The tuple() conversion function makes tuples from other things:

```{python, eval = F, echo = T}
suny_list = ['Geneseo', 'Borckport', 'Oswego']
tuple = tuple(suny_list)
```
]

.panel[.panel-name[with `+`]
### Combine Tuples by Using `+`
- This is similar to combining strings:

```{python, eval = F, echo = T}
('Geneseo',) + ('Borckport', 'Oswego')
```

]

.panel[.panel-name[with `*`]
### Duplicate Items with `*`
- This is like repeated use of `+`:

```{python, eval = F, echo = T}
('yada',) * 3
```

]

.panel[.panel-name[comparision]
### Compare Tuples
- This works much like list comparisons:

```{python, eval = F, echo = T}
a = (7, 2)
b = (7, 2, 9)
a == b
a <= b
a < b
```

]

.panel[.panel-name[`for` loop]
### Iterate with `for` and `in`
- Tuple iteration is like iteration of other types:

```{python, eval = F, echo = T}
words = ('fresh','out', 'of', 'ideas')
for word in words:
    print(word)
```

]

.panel[.panel-name[with `+=`]
### Modify a Tuple
- We can’t! 
  - Like strings, tuples are immutable, so we can’t change an existing one. 
  - As we saw just before, we can concatenate (combine) tuples to make a new one, as we can with strings:

```{python, eval = F, echo = T}
t1 = ('Fee', 'Fie', 'Foe')
id(t1)
t2 = ('Flop,')
t1 + t2
t1 += t2
id(t1)
```

]


]



---
# Lists

- Lists are good for keeping track of things by their order, especially when the order and contents might change.

  - Lists are *mutable*---we can change a list in place, add new elements, and delete or replace existing elements. 
  
  - The same value can occur more than once in a list.
  



---
# Lists

.panelset[
.panel[.panel-name[with `[]`]
### <p style="color:#00449E"> Create with [] </p>

- A list is made from zero or more elements, separated by commas and surrounded by
square brackets:
```{python, eval = F, echo = T}
empty_list = [ ]
weekdays = ['Monday', 'Tuesday', 'Wednesday', 'Thursday', 'Friday']
big_birds = ['emu', 'ostrich', 'cassowary']
first_names = ['Mary', 'Susan', 'Nicholas', 'Nicholas', 'Michael']
leap_years = [2012, 2016, 2020]
```

]



.panel[.panel-name[`list()`]
### Create or Convert with `list()`
- We can also make an empty list with the `list()` function.

- `list()` function also converts other iterable data types (such as tuples, strings, sets, and dictionaries) to lists.

```{python, eval = F, echo = T}
another_empty_list = list()
another_empty_list

list('cat')

a_tuple = ('ready', 'fire', 'aim')
list(a_tuple)
```
]


.panel[.panel-name[`split()`]
### Create from a String with `split()`
- We can use `split()` to chop a string into a *list* by some separator:

```{python, eval = F, echo = T}
coffee_day = '10/1/2022'
coffee_day.split('/')

splitme = 'a/b//c/d///e'
splitme.split('/')
splitme.split('//')
```
]

]


---
# Lists

.panelset[
.panel[.panel-name[`[offset]`]
### Get an Item by `[offset]`
- As with strings, we can extract a single value from a list by specifying its offset:
```{python, eval = F, echo = T}
suny = ['Geneseo', 'Brockport', 'Oswego']
```

.pull-left[
```{python, eval = F, echo = T}
suny[0]
suny[1]
suny[2]
suny[5]
```
]
.pull-right[
```{python, eval = F, echo = T}
suny[-1]
suny[-2]
suny[-3]
suny[-5]
```
]

]



.panel[.panel-name[slice]
### Get an Item with a Slice
- We can extract a subsequence of a list by using a *slice*:
```{python, eval = F, echo = T}
suny = ['Geneseo', 'Brockport', 'Oswego']
suny[0:2]    # A slice of a list is also a list.
```


.pull-left[
```{python, eval = F, echo = T}
suny[::2]
suny[::-2]
suny[::-1]
```
]
.pull-right[
```{python, eval = F, echo = T}
suny[4:]
suny[-6:]
suny[-6:-2]
suny[-6:-4]
```
]


]



.panel[.panel-name[`reverse()`]
### Reverse a list with `reverse()`
- To reverse a list in place, use `list.reverse()`:
```{python, eval = F, echo = T}
suny.reverse()
suny
```

]


.panel[.panel-name[`append()`]
### Add an Item to the End with `append()`
- The `append()` function adds items to the end of the list.
```{python, eval = F, echo = T}
suny = ['Geneseo', 'Brockport', 'Oswego']
suny.append('Buffalo')
suny

suny = ['Geneseo', 'Brockport', 'Oswego']
others = ['Buffalo', 'Cortland']
suny.append(others)
suny
```

]


.panel[.panel-name[`insert()`]
### Add an Item by Offset with `insert()`
- When we want to add an item before any offset in the list, we can use `insert()`.
```{python, eval = F, echo = T}
suny = ['Geneseo', 'Brockport', 'Oswego']
suny.insert(2, 'Buffalo')
suny
suny.insert(10, 'Cortland')
suny
```

]


.panel[.panel-name[`*`]
### Duplicate All Items with *
- We saw that we can duplicate a string’s characters with `*`. The same works for a list:
```{python, eval = F, echo = T}
["blah"] * 3

suny = ['Geneseo', 'Brockport', 'Oswego']
suny * 2
```

]



.panel[.panel-name[`extend()`]
### Combine Lists by Using `extend()` or `+`
- We can merge one list into another by using `extend()` or `+`.
```{python, eval = F, echo = T}
suny = ['Geneseo', 'Brockport', 'Oswego']
others = ['Buffalo', 'Cortland']
suny.extend(others)
suny

suny = ['Geneseo', 'Brockport', 'Oswego']
others = ['Buffalo', 'Cortland']
suny += others
suny
```

]


]



---
# Change Items in a List
### <p style="color:#00449E">  </p>

.panelset[
.panel[.panel-name[`[offset]`]
### Change an Item by `[offset]`
- Just as you can get the value of a list item by its offset, we can change it:

```{python, eval = F, echo = T}
suny = ['Geneseo', 'Brockport', 'Oswego']
suny[2] = 'Buffalo'
suny
```

- We can change how many items a list contains as well as the items themselves.

- We can assign values to a sublist with a slice.
```{python, eval = F, echo = T}
numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4]
numbers[1:3] = ['eight', 'nine']
numbers
```
]
.pull-right[
- The right-hand thing that we’re assigning to the list doesn’t need to have the same number of elements as the slice on the left:
```{python, eval = F, echo = T}
numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4]
numbers[1:3] = [7, 8, 9]
numbers
```
]

]


.panel[.panel-name[`del`]
### Delete an Item by Offset with `del`
- We can use a `del` statement to delete an item by its position in a list.

```{python, eval = F, echo = T}
suny = ['Geneseo', 'Brockport', 'Oswego', 'Rochester']
suny[-1]
del suny[-1]    
suny
```

]


.panel[.panel-name[`remove()`]
### Delete an Item by Value with `remove()`
- If we're not sure or don’t care where the item is in the list, we can use `remove()` to delete it by value.

```{python, eval = F, echo = T}
suny = ['Geneseo', 'Brockport', 'Oswego', 'Rochester']
suny.remove('Rochester')
suny

suny = ['Geneseo', 'Brockport', 'Oswego', 'Rochester', 'Rochester']
suny.remove('Rochester')
suny
```

]


.panel[.panel-name[`pop()`]
### Get an Item by Offset and Delete It with `pop()`
- We can get an item from a list and delete it from the list at the same time by using `pop()`.
  - If we call `pop()` with an offset, it will return the item at that offset; with no argument, it uses -1.

```{python, eval = F, echo = T}
suny = ['Geneseo', 'Brockport', 'Oswego', 'Rochester']
suny.pop()
suny
suny.pop(1)
suny
```

]


.panel[.panel-name[`clear()`]
### Delete All Items with `clear()`
- We can use `clear()` to clear a list of all its elements:

```{python, eval = F, echo = T}
suny_roc = ['Rochester', 'Rochester', 'Rochester', 'Rochester']
suny.clear()
suny
```

]



]

# Lists
### <p style="color:#00449E">  </p>

.panelset[
.panel[.panel-name[`index()`]
### Find an Item’s Offset by Value with `index()`
- If we want to know the offset of an item in a list by its value, we use `index()`:

```{python, eval = F, echo = T}
suny = ['Geneseo', 'Brockport', 'Oswego', 'Buffalo']
suny.index('Geneseo')

suny = ['Geneseo', 'Brockport', 'Oswego', 'Geneseo']
suny.index('Geneseo')
```

]


.panel[.panel-name[`in`]
### Test for a Value with `in`
- The way to check for the existence of a value in a list is using `in`:

```{python, eval = F, echo = T}
suny = ['Geneseo', 'Brockport', 'Oswego', 'Buffalo']
'Geneseo' in suny
'Rochester' in suny

words = ['a', 'deer', 'a' 'male', 'deer']
'deer' in words
```

]


.panel[.panel-name[`count()`]
### Count Occurrences of a Value with `count()`
- To count how many times a particular value occurs in a list, we can use `count()`:

```{python, eval = F, echo = T}
suny = ['Geneseo', 'Brockport', 'Oswego', 'Buffalo']
suny.count('Geneseo')
suny.count('Rochester')

mcdonald = ['cheeseburger', 'cheeseburger', 'cheeseburger']
mcdonald.count('cheeseburger')
```

]




.panel[.panel-name[`join()`]
### Convert a List to a String with `join()`
- `join()` is a string method, not a list method.

```{python, eval = F, echo = T}
suny = ['Geneseo', 'Brockport', 'Oswego', 'Buffalo']
', '.join(suny)
```
  - We can’t say `suny.join(', ')`.

- The argument to `join()` is a string or any iterable sequence of strings (including a list), and its output is a string.


]


.panel[.panel-name[`sort`]
### Reorder Items with `sort()` or `sorted()`
- We may often need to sort the items in a list by their values rather than their offsets.
  - The list method `sort()` sorts the list itself, in place.
  - The general function `sorted()` returns a sorted copy of the list.

.pull-left[
```{python, eval = F, echo = T}
suny = ['Geneseo', 'Brockport', 
        'Oswego']
sorted_suny = sorted(suny)
sorted_suny
suny
```

]
.pull-right[
```{python, eval = F, echo = T}
suny.sort()
suny
```

]
]


.panel[.panel-name[`reverse=True`]
### Reorder Items with `sort()` or `sorted()`
- The default sort order is ascending, but we can add the argument `reverse=True` to set it to descending.

.pull-left[
```{python, eval = F, echo = T}
numbers = [2, 1, 4.0, 3]
numbers.sort()
numbers
numbers = [2, 1, 4.0, 3]
numbers.sort(reverse=True)
numbers
```

]
.pull-right[
```{python, eval = F, echo = T}
suny = ['Geneseo', 'Brockport', 
        'Oswego']
sorted_suny = sorted(suny, 
                     reverse=True)
sorted_suny
```

]
]




.panel[.panel-name[`len()`]
### Get Length with `len()`
- `len()` returns the number of items in a list:

```{python, eval = F, echo = T}
suny = ['Geneseo', 'Brockport', 'Oswego']
len(suny)
```

]




]

# Lists
### <p style="color:#00449E">  </p>

.panelset[

.panel[.panel-name[`=`]
### Assign with `=`
- When we assign one list to more than one variable, changing the list in one place also changes it in the other:

.pull-left[
```{python, eval = F, echo = T}
a = [1, 2, 3]
b = a
b
a[0] = 'suprise'
a
```
- So what’s in `b` now?

]
.pull-right[
```{python, eval = F, echo = T}
b[0] = 'I hate suprises'
b
```
- So what’s in `a` now?
]
]



.panel[.panel-name[copy]
### Copy with copy(), list(), or a Slice
We can copy the values of a list to an independent, fresh list by using (1) the list `copy()` method, (2) the `list()` conversion function, or (3) the list slice `[:]`:
  
.pull-left[
```{python, eval = F, echo = T}
a = [1, 2, 3]
b = a.copy()
c = list(a)
d = a[:]
a[0] = 'integer lists'
```


]
.pull-right[
- `b`, `c`, and `d` are copies of `a`: 
  - They are new objects with their own values and no connection to the original list object [1, 2, 3] to which `a` refers.
  - What are `b`, `c`, and `d` now?

]
]


.panel[.panel-name[deepcopy]
### Copy with copy(), list(), or a Slice
- Using (1) the list `copy()` method, (2) the `list()` conversion function, or (3) the list slice `[:]` works well if the list values are all *immutable*.
  
.pull-left[
```{python, eval = F, echo = T}
a = [1, 2, [8, 9]]
b = a.copy()
c = list(a)
d = a[:]
a[2][1] = 10
```


]
.pull-right[
- `b`, `c`, and `d` are copies of `a`.
- The value of `a[2]` is now a list, and its elements can be changed.

  - What are `b`, `c`, and `d` now?
]
]




.panel[.panel-name[`deepcopy()`]
### Copy with copy(), list(), or a Slice
- To fix these *shallow* copies, we need to use the `deepcopy()` function:
  
.pull-left[
```{python, eval = F, echo = T}
import copy
a = [1, 2, [8, 9]]
b = copy.deepcopy(a)
a[2][1] = 10
a
b
```


]
.pull-right[
-  `deepcopy()` can handle deeply nested lists, dictionaries, and other objects.

- We'll discuss more about `import` later.
]
]




.panel[.panel-name[Comparison]
### Compare Lists
- We can directly compare lists with the comparison operators like `==`, `<`, and so on.

.pull-left[
```{python, eval = F, echo = T}
a = [7, 2]
b = [7, 2, 9]

a == b
a <= b
a < b
```


]
.pull-right[
- The operators walk through both lists, comparing elements at the same offsets. 
- If list `a` is shorter than list `b`, and all of its elements are equal, `a` is less than `b`.
]
]

# Lists
### <p style="color:#00449E"> Iterate with `for` and `in` </p>


.panelset[
.panel[.panel-name[`for`]
- `for` loop is quite common to iterate over lists.

```{python, eval = F, echo = T}
cheeses = ['brie', 'gjetost', 'havarti']
for cheese in cheeses:
    print(cheese)
```
]


.panel[.panel-name[`break`]
- `break` ends the for loop and `continue` steps to the next iteration:
```{python, eval = F, echo = T}
cheeses = ['brie', 'gjetost', 'havarti']
for cheese in cheeses:
    if cheese.startswith('g'):
        print("I won't eat anything that starts with 'g'")
        break
    else:
        print(cheese)
```
]


.panel[.panel-name[`else` (1)]
- We can still use the optional `else` if the for completed without a `break`:
```{python, eval = F, echo = T}
cheeses = ['brie', 'gjetost', 'havarti']
for cheese in cheeses:
    if cheese.startswith('x'):
        print("I won't eat anything that starts with 'x'")
        break
    else:
        print(cheese)
else:
    print("Didn't find anything that started with 'x'")
```
]

.panel[.panel-name[`else` (2)]
- If the initial `for` never ran, control goes to the `else`:
```{python, eval = F, echo = T}
cheeses = []
for cheese in cheeses:
    print('This shop has some lovely', cheese)
    break
else: # no break means no cheese
    print('This is not much of a cheese shop, is it?')
```
]

# Lists
### <p style="color:#00449E"> Iterate Multiple Sequences with `zip()` </p>

.panelset[
.panel[.panel-name[`for` and `zip()`]
- There’s one more nice iteration trick: iterating over multiple sequences in parallel by using the `zip()` function.

```{python, echo = T, eval = F}
days = ['Monday', 'Tuesday', 'Wednesday']
fruits = ['banana', 'orange', 'peach']
drinks = ['coffee', 'coffee', 'coffee']
desserts = ['tiramisu', 'ice cream', 'pie', 'pudding']
for day, fruit, drink, dessert in zip(days, fruits, drinks, desserts):
    print(day, ": drink", drink, "- eat", fruit, "- enjoy", dessert)

```

]

.panel[.panel-name[`zip()`, `list()`, and `dict()`]
- We can use `zip()` to walk through multiple sequences and make tuples from items at the same offsets.

```{python, echo = T, eval = F}
english = 'Monday', 'Tuesday', 'Wednesday'
french = 'Lundi', 'Mardi', 'Mercredi'

list( zip(english, french) )
dict( zip(english, french) )
```
- We will discuss how the `dict()` function can create dictionaries from two-item sequences like tuples, lists, or strings later.

# Lists
### <p style="color:#00449E"> Create a List with a Comprehension </p>

- Here, we look at how to create a list with a list *comprehension*, which incorporates the `for`/`in` iteration that we just saw.

  - Let's make a list of integers from 1 to 5:

.panelset[
.panel[.panel-name[`append()`]
```{python, echo = T, eval = F}
number_list = []
number_list.append(1)
number_list.append(2)
number_list.append(3)
number_list.append(4)
number_list.append(5)
```
]


.panel[.panel-name[`for`/`append()`]
```{python, echo = T, eval = F}
number_list = []
for number in range(1, 6):
    number_list.append(number)

number_list
```
]


.panel[.panel-name[`range()`]
```{python, echo = T, eval = F}
number_list = list(range(1, 6))
number_list
```
]


.panel[.panel-name[comprehession]
```{python, echo = T, eval = F}
number_list = [number for number in range(1,6)]
number_list
```
]

# Lists
### <p style="color:#00449E"> Create a List with a Comprehension </p>


.panelset[
.panel[.panel-name[basic]
- *List comprehensions* are a convenient and widely used Python language feature. 
  - The simplest form of list comprehension looks like this:

```{r, echo=FALSE, out.width = '66%', fig.align='center'}
knitr::include_graphics("../lec_figs/int-py-list-comprehension.png")
```
]

.panel[.panel-name[example 1]
```{python, echo = T, eval = F}
number_list = [number for number in range(1,6)]
number_list
```
- In the first line, we need the first `number` variable to produce values for the list: that is, to put a result of the loop into `number_list`. 

- The second `number` is part of the for loop.
]

.panel[.panel-name[example 2]
- To show that the first `number` in example 1 is an expression, try this variant:

```{python, echo = T, eval = F}
number_list = [number - 1 for number in range(1,6)]
number_list
```
- The list comprehension moves the loop inside the square brackets.
]


.panel[.panel-name[with if]
- A list comprehension can include a conditional expression, looking something like this:

```{r, echo=FALSE, out.width = '50%', fig.align='center'}
knitr::include_graphics("../lec_figs/int-py-list-comprehension-if.png")
```


- Let’s make a new comprehension that builds a list of only the odd numbers between 1 and 5.
```{python, echo = T, eval = F}
a_list = [number for number in range(1,6) if number % 2 == 1]
```
]

.panel[.panel-name[traditional `for`]
- Now, the comprehension is a little more compact than its traditional counterpart:
```{python, echo = T, eval = F}
a_list = []
for number in range(1,6):
    if number % 2 == 1:
        a_list.append(number)
```
]


]

# Lists
### <p style="color:#00449E"> Create a List with a Comprehension </p>

.panelset[
.panel[.panel-name[nested `for`]
- Just as there can be nested loops, there can be more than one set of `for ...` clauses in the corresponding comprehension.

```{python, echo = T, eval = F}
rows = range(1,4)
cols = range(1,3)
for row in rows:
    for col in cols:
        print(row, col)
```
]


.panel[.panel-name[comprehension using nested `for`]
- Let’s use a comprehension and assign it to the variable cells, making it a list of *(row, col)* tuples:

```{python, echo = T, eval = F}
rows = range(1,4)
cols = range(1,3)
cells = [(row, col) for row in rows for col in cols]

for cell in cells:
    print(cell)
```

]

.panel[.panel-name[tuple unpacking]
- We can also use *tuple unpacking* to get the row and col values from each tuple as you iterate over the cells list.

```{python, echo = T, eval = F}
rows = range(1,4)
cols = range(1,3)
cells = [(row, col) for row in rows for col in cols]

for row, col in cells:
    print(row, col)
```

]


]

# Lists
### <p style="color:#00449E"> Lists of Lists </p>

- Lists can contain elements of different types, including other lists:

```{python, echo = T, eval = F}
small_birds = ['hummingbird', 'finch']
extinct_birds = ['dodo', 'passenger pigeon', 'Norwegian Blue']
carol_birds = [3, 'French hens', 2, 'turtledoves']
all_birds = [small_birds, extinct_birds, 'macaw', carol_birds]
```

- So what does `all_birds`, a list of lists, look like?

```{python, echo = T, eval = F}
all_birds
all_birds[0]
all_birds[1]
all_birds[1][0]  # [0] refers to the first item in that inner list.
```



---
# Tuples and Lists
### <p style="color:#00449E"> Tuples Versus Lists </p>
- We can often use tuples in place of lists, but tuples have many fewer functions—there is no `append()`, `insert()`, and so on—because they can’t be modified after creation.


- Why not just use lists instead of tuples everywhere?
  - Tuples use less space.
  - We can’t clobber tuple items by mistake.
  - We can use tuples as dictionary keys, which we will cover later.


- In everyday programming, we would use lists and dictionaries more.



---
# Tuples and Lists
### <p style="color:#00449E"> There Are No Tuple Comprehensions </p>
- Mutable types (lists, dictionaries, and sets) have comprehensions. 
  
  
- Would changing the square brackets of a list comprehension to
parentheses create a tuple comprehension? 

```{python, echo = T, eval = F}
number_thing = (number for number in range(1, 6))
type(number_thing)
```

- A *generator* is one way to provide data to an iterator.
