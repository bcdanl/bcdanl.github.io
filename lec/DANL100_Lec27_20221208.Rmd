# Workflow

- **Home/End** moves the blinking cursor bar to the beginning/End of the line.
  - **Ctrl** (**command** for Mac Users) **+** `r fa("arrow-left")` / `r fa("arrow-right")` works too.


- **Ctrl** (**command** for Mac Users) **+ Z** undoes the previous action.
- **Ctrl** (**command** for Mac Users) **+ Shift + Z** redoes when undo is executed.


- **Ctrl** (**command** for Mac Users) **+ F** is useful when finding a phrase (and replace the phrase) in the RScript.

- Auto-completion of command is useful.
  - Type `libr` in the RScript in RStudio and wait for a second.

# Workflow

- To install R package `PACKAGE`, use `install.packages("PACKAGE")`.
```{r, echo = T, eval = F}
install.packages("ggplot2")  # installing package "ggplot2"
```

- When the code is running, RStudio shows the STOP icon (`r fa("fas fa-stop", fill = "red")`) at the top right corner in the Console Pane.
  - Do not click it unless if you want to stop running the code.

```{r, echo=FALSE, out.width = '90%', fig.align='center'}
knitr::include_graphics("../lec_figs/console-running.png")
```


---
# Workflow
### <p style="color:#00449E"> Quotation marks, parentheses, and `+` </p>


- Quotation marks and parentheses must always come in a pair.
  - If not, Console Pane will show you the continuation character `+`:

```{r, echo = T, eval = F}
> x <- "hello
```

- The `+` tells you that R is waiting for more input; it doesn’t think you’re done yet.

# Starting with R
### <p style="color:#00449E"> Assignment </p>
- R has many assignment operators (e.g., `<-`, `=`, `->` ).
- The preferred one is `<-`.

```{r, echo = T, eval = F}
x <- 2
x < - 3
print(x)

x <- 5
x = 5
5 -> x
```



---
# Starting with R
### <p style="color:#00449E"> R variables and data types </p>

- **Variables** can be thought of as a labelled container used to store information. 

- Variables allow us to recall saved information to later use in calculations. 

- Variables can store many different things in RStudio, from single values, data frames, to graphs.

# R variable and data types
### <p style="color:#00449E">  </p>


.panelset[

.panel[.panel-name[Character]
- Strings are known as “character” in R. 
- Use the double quotes " or single quotes ' to wrap around the string

```{r, echo = T, eval = F}
myname <- "my_name"
class(myname)

```
- `class()` function returns the data type of an object.
]


.panel[.panel-name[Numbers]
- Numbers have different classes. 
  - The most common two are integer and numeric. Integers are whole numbers:

```{r, echo = T, eval = F}
favourite.integer <- as.integer(2)
print(favourite.integer)
class(favourite.integer)

favourite.numeric <- as.numeric(8.8)
print(favourite.numeric)
class(favourite.numeric)

pvalue.threshold <- 0.05
```
]


.panel[.panel-name[Logical (TRUE/FALSE)]
- We use the `==` to test for equality in R

```{r, echo = T, eval = F}
class(TRUE)
favourite.numeric == 8.8
favourite.numeric == 9.9
```
]



.panel[.panel-name[Vectors]
- We can create 1D data structures called “vectors”.

```{r, echo = T, eval = F}
1:10
2*(1:10)
seq(0, 10, 2)
myvector <- 1:10
myvector
b <- c(3,4,5)
b^2
beers <- c("BUD LIGHT", "BUSCH LIGHT", "COORS LIGHT", "MILLER LITE", "NATURAL LIGHT")
beers

```
]



.panel[.panel-name[Factors]
- Factors store categorical data. 

- Under the hood, factors are actually integers that have a string label attached to each unique integer. 
  - For example, if we have a long list of Male/Female labels for each of our patients, this will be stored a “row” of zeros and ones by R.


```{r, echo = T, eval = F}
beers <- as.factor(beers)
class(beers)
levels(beers)
nlevels(beers)

```
]


]

# Starting with R
### <p style="color:#00449E"> NULL and NA values </p>

- `NULL` is just an alias for `c()`, the empty vector.
- `NA` indicates missing or unavailable data.

```{r, echo = T, eval = F}
c(c(), 1, NULL)
c("a", NA, "c")
```

# Working with Data from Files

- Step 0. Download the zip file, 'car_data.zip' from the Files section in our Canvas.

- Step 1. Find the path name for the file, `car.data.csv`.

- Step 2. In the code below, replace 'PATH_NAME_FOR_THE_FILE_car.data.csv' with the path name for the file, `car.data.csv`.

- Step 3. Run the following R code:

```{r, eval = F, echo = T}
# install.packages("readr")
library(readr)

uciCar <- read_csv(
		'PATH_NAME_FOR_THE_FILE_car.data.csv')
View(uciCar)
```

---
# Working with Data from Files
### <p style="color:#00449E"> Examining data frame </p>

- `class()` tells you what kind of R object you have. 
- `dim()` shows how many rows and columns are in the data for `data.frame`.
- `head()` shows the top few rows of the data.
- `help()` provides the documentation for a class. 
  - Try `help(class(uciCar))`.
- `str()` gives us the structure for an object.


---
# Working with Data from Files
### <p style="color:#00449E"> Examining data frame </p>

- `summary()` provides a summary of almost any R object. 
- `skimr::skim()` provides a more detailed summary.
  - `skimr` is the package that provides the function `skim()`.
- `print()` prints all the data. 
  - Note: for large datasets, this can take a very long time and is something you want to avoid.
- `View()` displays the data in a simple spreadsheet-like grid viewer.
- `dplyr::glimpse()` displays brief information about the data.

# Working with Data from Files
### <p style="color:#00449E"> Reading data from an URL </p>

- We can import the data file from the web.

```{r, eval = F, echo = T}
# install.packages("readr")
# library(readr)

tvshows <- read_csv(
		'https://bcdanl.github.io/data/tvshows.csv')
```



---
# Working with Data from Files
### <p style="color:#00449E"> Accessing Subsets </p>


.panelset[

.panel[.panel-name[head() & tail()]
- `head()` returns the first N rows of our data frame.
- `tail()` returns the last N rows of our data frame.


```{r, eval = F, echo = T}
head(tvshows, n = 3)
head(tvshows, 3)
tail(tvshows, 3)
```
]


.panel[.panel-name[row]
- As in Python, we can use the same slicing methods in R.
  - Starting index in R is 1, unlike Python.
```{r, eval = F, echo = T}
tvshows[ 1:3, ]
tvshows[ c(1, 2, 3), ]
tvshows[ c(1, 2, 3), 1]
```
]



.panel[.panel-name[column]
- Return the “Network” column in the data set:

```{r, eval = F, echo = T}
tvshows$Network
tvshows[, 2]
tvshows[, "Network"]
```

- Return the columns named “Show” and “GRP”

```{r, eval = F, echo = T}
tvshows[ , c("Show", "GRP")]
```
]



.panel[.panel-name[row & column]
- Return only the first 3 rows and columns 2 and 5 of the data set

```{r, eval = F, echo = T}
tvshows[1:3, c(2,5)]
```
]


.panel[.panel-name[filtering]
- Return only the shows whose `Genre` is `Reality`.

```{r, eval = F, echo = T}
tvshows[ tvshows$Genre == "Reality",  ]
```

- Another way to subset the shows is with the `which()` function.    - This returns the TRUE indices of a logical object.

```{r, eval = F, echo = T}
reality <- which(tvshows$Genre == "Reality")
reality
tvshows[ reality, ]
```

]



.panel[.panel-name[filtering]
- What if we want all shows whose PE is greater than 80?

```{r, eval = F, echo = T}
tvshows[tvshows$PE > 80, ]
```

- Another way to subset the shows is with the `which()` function.    - This returns the TRUE indices of a logical object.

```{r, eval = F, echo = T}
reality <- which(tvshows$Genre == "Reality")
reality
tvshows[ reality, ]
```

]



]



---
# Working with Data from Files
### <p style="color:#00449E"> Class Exercises 2 </p>
1. Return those shows whose `Duration` values are `30`.

2. Return those shows whose `GRP` values are greater than the mean value of `GRP`.

2. Return the data.frame with only three variables---`Show`, `PE`, and `GRP`---for which `PE` values are greater than the mean value of `PE`.

---
#  `ggplot2`

```{r, echo=FALSE, out.width = '20%', fig.align='center'}
knitr::include_graphics("../lec_figs/ggplot2-logo.png")
```

- `ggplot2` is a R data visualization package based on [The Grammar of Graphics](http://vita.had.co.nz/papers/layered-grammar.pdf). 
  - `ggplot2` is the most elegant and most versatile visualization tools in R.
  - We provide the data, tell `ggplot2` how to map variables to `aes`thetics, what graphical primitives to use, and it takes care of the details.

```{r, echo = T, eval = F}
library(ggplot2)
```



---
# Data Visualization with `ggplot2`
### <p style="color:#00449E"> Types of plots

- We will consider the following types of visualization:

  - Bar chart

  - Histogram

  - Scatter plot
  
  - Scatter plot with Fitted line

  - Line chart



---
# Data Visualization with `ggplot2`
### <p style="color:#00449E"> Getting started with `ggplot2`

- Let's use the `titanic` and `tips` data.frames:

```{r, echo = T, eval = F}
df_titanic <- read_csv('https://bcdanl.github.io/data/titanic_cleaned.csv')
df_tips <- read_csv('https://bcdanl.github.io/data/tips_seaborn.csv')
```



---
# Data Visualization with `ggplot2`
### <p style="color:#00449E"> Bar Chart 

- A bar chart is used to plot the frequency of the different categories.
  - It is useful to visualize how values of a **categorical variable** are distributed.
  - A variable is **categorical** if it can only take one of a small set of values.
  
  
- We use `geom_bar()` function to plot a bar chart:


.pull-left[
```{r, echo = T, eval = F}
ggplot( data = df_titanic ) +
  geom_bar( aes(x = sex) )
```
]

.pull-right[

- Mapping
  - `data`: data.frame
  - `x`:  Name of a categorical variable (column) in data.frame

]








---
# Data Visualization with `ggplot2`
### <p style="color:#00449E"> Bar Chart 

- We can further break up the bars in the bar chart based on another categorical variable. 

  - This is useful to visualize the relationship between the two categorical variables.


.pull-left[
```{r, echo = T, eval = F}
ggplot( data = df_titanic ) +
  geom_bar( aes( x = sex,
                 fill = survived ) )
```
]

.pull-right[

- Mapping
  - `fill`:  Name of a categorical variable

]





---
# Data Visualization with `ggplot2`
### <p style="color:#00449E"> Histogram 

- A histogram is a **continuous** version of a bar chart.
  - It is used to plot the frequency of the different values.
  - It is useful to visualize how values of a **continuous variable** are distributed.
  - A variable is **continuous** if it can take any of an infinite set of ordered values.
  
  
- We use `geom_histogram()` function to plot a histogram:
.pull-left[
```{r, echo = T, eval = F}
ggplot(data = df_titanic) +
  geom_histogram( aes( x = age ), 
                    bins = 5 )
```
]

.pull-right[
- Mapping
  - `bins`:  Number of bins

]




---
# Data Visualization with `ggplot2`
### <p style="color:#00449E"> Scatter plot 

- A scatter plot is used to display the relationship between two continuous variables.

  -  We can see co-variation as a pattern in the scattered points.

- We use `geom_point()` function to plot a scatter plot:

.pull-left[
```{r, echo = T, eval = F}
ggplot( data = df_tips ) +
  geom_point( aes( x = total_bill, 
                   y = tip ) )
```
]

.pull-right[
- Mapping
  - `x`:  Name of a continuous variable on the horizontal axis
  - `y`:  Name of a continuous variable on the vertical axis
]


---
# Data Visualization with `ggplot2`
### <p style="color:#00449E"> Scatter plot 

- To the scatter plot, we can add a `color`-`VARIABLE` mapping to display how the relationship between two continuous variables varies by `VARIABLE`.

- Suppose we are interested in the following question:
  - **Q**. Does a smoker and a non-smoker have a difference in tipping behavior?

```{r, echo = T, eval = F}
ggplot( data = df_tips ) +
  geom_point( aes( x = total_bill, y = tip,
                   color = smoker ) )
```



---
# Data Visualization with `ggplot2`
### <p style="color:#00449E"> Fitted line 

- From the scatter plot, it is often difficult to clearly see the relationship between two continuous variables.
  - `geom_smooth( method = lm )` adds a line that fits well into the scattered points.
  - On average, the fitted line describes the relationship between two continuous variables.
  

```{r, echo = T, eval = F, message= F, warning= F}
ggplot( data = df_tips ) +
  geom_point( aes( x = total_bill, y = tip,
                   color = smoker ) ) +
  geom_smooth( aes( x = total_bill, y = tip,
                    color = smoker ),
               method = lm )
```



---
# Data Visualization with `ggplot2`
### <p style="color:#00449E"> Line cahrt 

- A line chart is used to display the trend in a continuous variable or the change in a continuous variable over other variable.

  - It draws a line by connecting the scattered points in order of the variable on the x-axis, so that it highlights exactly when changes occur.
  
  - We use `geom_line()` function to plot a line plot:

```{r, echo = T, eval = F}
path_csv <- 'THE_PATHNAME_FOR_THE_FILE__dji.csv'
dow <- read_csv(path_csv)

ggplot( data = dow ) +
  geom_line( aes( x = Date, y = Close ) )
```
