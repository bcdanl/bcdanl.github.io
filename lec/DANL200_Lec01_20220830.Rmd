### <p style="color:#00449E">Grading</p>

- Homework assignments account for 33% of the total percentage grade.

- Exams account for 67% of the total percentage grade.

$$ 
\begin{align}
&(\text{Total Percentage Grade}) \notag\\

# Syllabus

### <p style="color:#00449E">Grading</p>

- The total exam score is the maximum between the following two average scores:
  1. the simple average of two exam scores;
  2. the weighted average of them with one-fourth weight on the midterm exam score and three-fourth weight on the final exam score.
  
$$
\begin{align}
&(\text{Total Exam Score}) \notag\\
=\; &\max\,\left\{0.5\times(\text{Midterm Exam Score}) \,+\, 0.5\times(\text{Final Exam Score})\right.,\notag\\

# Code chunks and inline R code

### <p style="color:#00449E">R Markdown Code</p>

```r
library(tidyverse)
oj <- read_csv('https://bcecon.github.io/dominick_oj.csv')
nvars <- format(round(ncol(oj), 0), 
                nsmall=0, 
                big.mark=",") 
nobs <- format(round(nrow(oj), 0), 
                nsmall=0, 
                big.mark=",") 
```

The number of variables is <code>&grave;r nvars&grave;</code>; the number of observations is <code>&grave;r nobs&grave;</code>.



### <p style="color:#00449E">Output</p>

```{r, message=F}
library(tidyverse)
oj <- read_csv(
  'https://bcdanl.github.io/data/dominick_oj.csv')
nvars <- format(round(ncol(oj), 0),

# Font color

- The Markdown syntax has no built-in method for changing text colors. We can use HTML syntax to change the formatting of words:



### <p style="color:#00449E">R Markdown Code</p>

```r
Roses are <span style="color: red;">red</span>, violets are <span style="color: blue;">blue</span>.
```

### <p style="color:#00449E">Output</p>

Roses are <span style="color: red;">red</span>, violets are <span style="color: red;">blue</span>.

---


# Spacing

- To add a space between paragraphs or lines, you can use `<br>`.


.pull-left[
### <p style="color:#00449E">R Markdown Code</p>

```r
One
<br>

Two
```
]

.pull-right[
### <p style="color:#00449E">Output</p>

One
<br>

Two
]

# YAML

- Here is an example of the YAML metadata for an HTML document from R Markdown:

.pull-left[
### <p style="color:#00449E">R Markdown YAML Example</p>

```r
title: "TITLE_OF_YOUR_PROJECT"
subtitle: "SUBTITLE_OF_YOUR_PROJECT<br><br>" 
author: 
  - "AUTHOR_1"
  - "AUTHOR_2"
  - <br>
date: "`r Sys.Date()`<br><br>"

output: 
  html_document:
    df_print: paged
    toc: true
    toc_depth: 2
    toc_float: true
    number_sections: true
    theme: united
    highlight: tango
```
]

.pull-right[
### <p style="color:#00449E"> `theme` </p>
- `theme` specifies the Bootstrap theme to use for the page (themes are drawn from the Bootswatch theme library). 
  - Valid themes include `default`, `bootstrap`, `cerulean`, `cosmo`, `darkly`, `flatly`, `journal`, `lumen`, `paper`, `readable`, `sandstone`, `simplex`, `spacelab`, `united`, and `yeti.`

  - Pass `null` for no theme (in this case you can use the `css` parameter to add your own styles).
