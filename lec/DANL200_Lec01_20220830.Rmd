### <p style="color:#00449E">Grading</p>

- The total exam score is the maximum between the following two average scores:
  1. the simple average of two exam scores;
  2. the weighted average of them with one-fourth weight on the midterm exam score and three-fourth weight on the final exam score.
  
$$
\begin{align}
&(\text{Total Exam Score}) \notag\\
=\; &\max\,\left\{0.5\times(\text{Midterm Exam Score}) \,+\, 0.5\times(\text{Final Exam Score})\right.,\notag\\

# Data Science Process

### <p style="color:#00449E">Motivational example of data science project</p>

- Suppose you're interested in how much social media campaigns are effective on climate change legislation.

- The fossil fuel industry may feel that it's losing too much money because of regulations related to climate change and wants to reduce its losses via lobbying. 

- To what extent do social media campaigns competite against fossil fuel lobbying on climate change legislation?

# Social Media

### <p style="color:#00449E">Narratives in Social Media Campaigns</p>

- Social media campaigns have increasingly become more politically influential. 
  - My text analysis indicates that at least 20% of US tweets with #climatechange/#globalwarming during 2012-2017 contain some political words. 

- The two most frequently appeared words from the US tweets with #climatechange/#globalwarming during 2012-2017 are:
  - **UniteBlue**: an organization or slogan for the wide range of the left activists.
  - **Tcot**: an acronym for ``Top Conservative on Twitter.''

# Social Media

### <p style="color:#00449E">Sentiment in Social Media Campaigns</p>

- Sentiment in social media campaigns may play an important role in forming public opinion.

- Some research finds that ...
  - Sentiment of tweets can contribute to the vote outcome.
  - Information with negative sentiment is transmitted faster than one with positive sentiment.
