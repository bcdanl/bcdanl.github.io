# Tips for using Presentation Slides

<!-- ### <p style="color:#00449E"></p> -->

- To go to a previous/next page, use keyboard arrows, `r fa("arrow-left")` and `r fa("arrow-right")`.

- To see a tile view of the lecture slides, use the alphabet key, `o`.

- If you hover a mouse cursor on the code block in the lecture slide, you can see and click the *"Copy Code"* from the top-right corner of the code block.
  - If you click the *"Copy Code"*, the codes in the block are copied, so that you can paste them to RScript.

- If the presentation slides does not respond, refresh the web-page of the slides by the shortcut, **Ctrl** (or **command** for Mac users) ** + R**.

- **Home/End** moves the blinking cursor bar to the beginning/End of the line.
  - **Ctrl** (**command** for Mac Users) **+** `r fa("arrow-left")` / `r fa("arrow-right")` works too.


- **Ctrl** (**command** for Mac Users) **+ Z** undoes the previous action.
- **Ctrl** (**command** for Mac Users) **+ Shift + Z** redoes when undo is executed.


- **Ctrl** (**command** for Mac Users) **+ F** is useful when finding a phrase (and replace the phrase) in the RScript.

- Auto-completion of command is useful.
  - Type `libr` in the RScript in RStudio and wait for a second.

# Workflow
### <p style="color:#00449E"> Quotation marks, parentheses, and `+` </p>


- Quotation marks and parentheses must always come in a pair.
  - If not, Console Pane will show you the continuation character `+`:

```r

# Starting with R
- Let's try a few commands to help you become familiar with R and its basic data types.

- In R, **vectors** are arrays of same-typed values.
  - They can be built with the `c()` notation.
  
.pull-left[
```r
1
1/2
'Joe'
"Joe"
"Joe"=='Joe'
c()
is.null(c())
is.null(5)
```
]
.pull-right[

```r
c(1)
c(1, 2)
c("Apple", 'Orange')
length(c(1, 2))
vec <- c(1, 2)
vec
```
]



---
# Starting with R
### <p style="color:#00449E"> Assignment </p>
- R has many assignment operators (e.g., `<-`, `=`, `->` ).
- The preferred one is `<-`.

```r
x <- 2
x < - 3
print(x)

x <- 5
x = 5
5 -> x
```


---
# Starting with R
### <p style="color:#00449E"> R data types </p>

- Primary data types in R are as follows:
  - **Logical**: A simple binary variable that may have only two values---TRUE or FALSE.
  - **Numeric**: Decimal numbers
  - **Integer**: Integers
  - **Character**: Text strings
  - **Factor**: Categorical values. Each possible value of a factor is known as a *level*.
  - **Ordered Factor**: A special factor data type where the order of the levels is significant. E.g., Low, Medium, and High



---
# Starting with R
### <p style="color:#00449E"> R data types </p>

- Test the data types.
```r
x <- TRUE
y <- 1
z <- 'Data Analytics'
productCategory <- c('fruit', 'vegetable', 'dry goods', 'fruit',
                     'vegetable', 'dry goods')
productCategoryFactor <- factor(productCategory)
```
- The `class()` function returns the data type of an object.
  - What are classes for `x`, `y`, `z`, `productCategory`, and `productCategoryFactor`?



---
# Starting with R
### <p style="color:#00449E"> R data types </p>


- Most R data types are *mutable*, in that we're allowed to change them.

```r
a <- c(1, 2)
b <- a

print(b)

# Alters a
a[[1]] <- 5

print(a)
print(b)
```


---
# Starting with R
### <p style="color:#00449E"> Lists </p>


- **Lists**, unlike *vectors*, can store more than one type of object.
  - The ways to access items in lists are the `$` operator and the `[[]]` operator.
  
```r
x <- list('a' = 6, b = 'fred')
names(x)

x$a
x$b

x[['a']]

x[c('a', 'a', 'b', 'b')]
```



---
# Starting with R
### <p style="color:#00449E"> R data types </p>


- Here are examples of a vector and a list.

```r
example_vector <- c(10, 20, 30)
example_list <- list(a = 10, b = 20, c = 30)

example_vector[1]
example_list[1]

example_vector[[2]]
example_list[[2]]

example_vector[c(FALSE, TRUE, TRUE)]
example_list[c(FALSE, TRUE, TRUE)]

example_list$b
example_list[["b"]]
```



---
# Starting with R
### <p style="color:#00449E"> Errors </p>


- Errors are just R's way of saying it safely refused to complete an ill-formed operation 

- Fear of errors should not limit experiments.

```r
x <- 1:5
print(x)

x <- meanMISSPELLED(x)  
print(x)                                 

x <- mean(x)                      
print(x)
```



---
# Starting with R
### <p style="color:#00449E"> Data Frames </p>

- R’s central data structure is the data frame. 
- A data frame is organized into rows and columns. 
- Data frames are essentially lists of columns.
- Data frames can have columns of different types.

.pull-left[
```r
d <- data.frame(x=c(1,2),
              y=c('a','b'))

d[['x']]
d$x
d[[1]]
```
]

.pull-right[
```r
d
d[1,]
d[,1]

d[1,1]
d[1, 'x']
```

]



---
# Starting with R
### <p style="color:#00449E"> Data Frames </p>

- The R **data.frame** class is designed to store data in a very good "ready for analysis" format.

```r
d <- data.frame(col1 = c(1, 2, 3), col2 = c(-1, 0, 1))
print(d)
d$col3 <- d$col1 + d$col2
print(d)
```

---
# Starting with R
### <p style="color:#00449E"> NULL and NA values </p>

- `NULL` is just an alias for `c()`, the empty vector.
- `NA` indicates missing or unavailable data.

```r
c(c(), 1, NULL)
c("a", NA, "c")
```


---
# Starting with R
### <p style="color:#00449E"> NULL and NA values </p>

- `NULL` is just an alias for `c()`, the empty vector.
- `NA` indicates missing or unavailable data.

```r
c(c(), 1, NULL)
c("a", NA, "c")
```

# Management of Files, Directories, and Scripts
### <p style="color:#00449E"> Code and comment style </p>
- The two main principles for coding and managing data are:
  - Make things easier for your future self.
  - Don't trust your future self.

- So we do make comments on codes.


---
# Management of Files, Directories, and Scripts
### <p style="color:#00449E"> Code and comment style </p>

- The `#` mark is R's comment character.
  - `#` indicates that the rest of the line is to be ignored.
  - Write comments before the line that you want the comment to apply to.

- Consider using block commenting for separating code sections.
  - `#####` defines a coding block.

- Break down long lines and long algebraic expressions.

# Working with Data from Files

- Step 1. Find the path name for the file, `car.data.csv`, from the sub-folder, 'UCICar' in the folder, 'PDSwR2-main'.

- Step 2. In the code below, replace 'PATH_NAME_FOR_THE_FILE_car.data.csv' with the path name for the file, `car.data.csv`.

- Step 3. Run the following R code:

```r
uciCar <- read.table(
		'PATH_NAME_FOR_THE_FILE_car.data.csv',
		sep = ',',
		header = TRUE,
		stringsAsFactor = TRUE )
View(uciCar)
```

# Working with Data from Files
### <p style="color:#00449E"> Examining data frame </p>

- `class()` tells you what kind of R object you have. 
- `dim()` shows how many rows and columns are in the data for `data.frame`.
- `head()` shows the top few rows of the data.
- `help()` provides the documentation for a class. 
  - Try `help(class(uciCar))`.
- `str()` gives us the structure for an object.


---
# Working with Data from Files
### <p style="color:#00449E"> Examining data frame </p>

- `summary()` provides a summary of almost any R object. 
- `skimr::skim()` provides a more detailed summary.
  - `skimr` is the package that provides the function `skim()`.
- `print()` prints all the data. 
  - Note: for large datasets, this can take a very long time and is something you want to avoid.
- `View()` displays the data in a simple spreadsheet-like grid viewer.
- `dplyr::glimpse()` displays brief information about the data.

  geom_point(aes(x=GRP, y=PE, color=Genre))
  
ggplot(tvshows) + 
  geom_point(aes(x=GRP, y=PE)) + 
  facet_wrap(~Genre)
```
-  How is the the relationship between audience size (`GRP`) and audience engagement (`PE`)?

# Exploratory Data Analysis

```{r, echo=FALSE, out.width = '40%', fig.align='center'}
knitr::include_graphics("../lec_figs/data-science-explore.png")
```

- In data visualization, you'll learn the basic structure of a `ggplot` plot. It turns data into plots.
  
- In data transformation, you'll learn the key verbs that allow you to select important variables, filter out key observations, create new variables, and compute summaries.

- In **exploratory data analysis**, you'll combine visualization and transformation with your curiosity and skepticism to ask and answer interesting questions about data.

# Data Visualization - First Steps

```r
library(tidyverse)
mpg
?mpg
```

- The `mpg` data frame, provided by `ggplot2`, contains observations collected by the US Environmental Protection Agency on 38 models of car.

- Q. Do cars with big engines use more fuel than cars with small engines?
  - `displ`: a car's engine size, in liters.
  - `hwy`: a car's fuel efficiency on the highway, in miles per gallon (mpg). 


---
# Data Visualization - First Steps
### <p style="color:#00449E"> Creating a `ggplot` </p>

-  What does the relationship between engine size and fuel efficiency look like?

  - To plot `mpg`, run the following code to put `displ` on the `x`-axis and `hwy` on the `y`-axis:

```r
ggplot(data = mpg) + 
  geom_point(mapping = aes(x = displ, y = hwy))
```



---
# Data Visualization - First Steps
### <p style="color:#00449E"> Graphing Template </p>
- To make a ggplot plot, replace the bracketed sections in the code below with a `data.frame`, a `geom` function, or a collection of mappings such as `x = VAR_1` and `y = VAR_2` .

```r
ggplot(data = <DATA>) + 
  <GEOM_FUNCTION>(mapping = aes(<MAPPINGS>))
```




---
# Data Visualization - First Steps
### <p style="color:#00449E"> Exercises </p>

1. Run `ggplot(data = mpg)`. What do you see?
```r
ggplot(data = mpg)
```

2. How many rows are in `mpg`? How many columns?

3. What does the `drv` variable describe? Read the help for `?mpg` to find out.

4. Make a scatterplot of `hwy` vs. `cyl`.

5. What happens if you make a scatterplot of `class` vs. `drv`? Why is the plot not useful?
