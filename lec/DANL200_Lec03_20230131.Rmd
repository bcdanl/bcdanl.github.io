# Workflow
### <p style="color:#00449E"> Code and comment style </p>
- The two main principles for coding and managing data are:
  - Make things easier for your future self.
  - Don't trust your future self.

- The `#` mark is R's comment character.
  - `#` indicates that the rest of the line is to be ignored.
  - Write comments before the line that you want the comment to apply to.

- Consider using block commenting for separating code sections.
  - `####` defines a coding block.

- Break down long lines and long algebraic expressions.



---
# Workflow
### <p style="color:#00449E"> Quotation marks, parentheses, and `+` </p>


- Quotation marks and parentheses must always come in a pair.
  - If not, Console Pane will show you the continuation character `+`:

```{r, echo = T, eval = F}
x <- "hello
```

- The `+` tells you that R is waiting for more input; it doesn’t think you’re done yet. 


---
# Workflow
### <p style="color:#00449E"> Installing R packages </p>

- To install R package `PACKAGE`, use `install.packages("PACKAGE")`.
```{r, echo = T, eval = F}
install.packages("ggplot2")  # installing package "ggplot2"
install.packages("readr")  # installing package "readr"
```

- When the code is running, RStudio shows the STOP icon (`r fa("fas fa-stop", fill = "red")`) at the top right corner in the Console Pane.
  - Do not click it unless if you want to stop running the code.

```{r, echo=FALSE, eval = T, out.width = '90%', fig.align='center'}

# Starting with R
### <p style="color:#00449E"> Assignment </p>
- R has many assignment operators (e.g., `<-`, `=`, `->` ).
- The preferred one is `<-`.

```{r, echo = T, eval = F}
x <- 2
x < - 3
print(x)

### <p style="color:#00449E"> R variables and data types </p>

- **Variables** can be thought of as a labelled container used to store information. 

- Variables allow us to recall saved information to later use in calculations. 

- Variables can store many different things in RStudio, from single values, data frames, to graphs.

# R variable and data types
### <p style="color:#00449E">  </p>


.panelset[

.panel[.panel-name[Character]
- Strings are known as “character” in R. 
- Use the double quotes " or single quotes ' to wrap around the string

```{r, echo = T, eval = F}
myname <- "my_name"
class(myname)

```
- `class()` function returns the data type of an object.
]


.panel[.panel-name[Numbers]
- Numbers have different classes. 
  - The most common two are integer and numeric. Integers are whole numbers:

```{r, echo = T, eval = F}
favourite.integer <- as.integer(2)
print(favourite.integer)
class(favourite.integer)

favourite.numeric <- as.numeric(8.8)
print(favourite.numeric)
class(favourite.numeric)

pvalue.threshold <- 0.05
```
]


.panel[.panel-name[Logical (TRUE/FALSE)]
- We use the `==` to test for equality in R

```{r, echo = T, eval = F}
class(TRUE)
favourite.numeric == 8.8
favourite.numeric == 9.9
```
]



.panel[.panel-name[Vectors]
- We can create 1D data structures called “vectors”.

```{r, echo = T, eval = F}
1:10
2*(1:10)
myvector <- 1:10
myvector
b <- c(3,4,5)
b^2
beers <- c("BUD LIGHT", "BUSCH LIGHT", "COORS LIGHT", "MILLER LITE", "NATURAL LIGHT")
beers

```
]



.panel[.panel-name[Factors]
- Factors store categorical data. 

- Under the hood, factors are actually integers that have a string label attached to each unique integer. 
  - For example, if we have a long list of Male/Female labels for each of our patients, this will be stored a “row” of zeros and ones by R.


```{r, echo = T, eval = F}
beers <- as.factor(beers)
class(beers)
levels(beers)
nlevels(beers)

```
]


]



---
# Starting with R
### <p style="color:#00449E"> NULL and NA values </p>

- `NULL` is just an alias for `c()`, the empty vector.
- `NA` indicates missing or unavailable data.

```{r, echo = T, eval = F}
c(c(), 1, NULL)
c("a", NA, "c")
```

reality <- which(tvshows$Genre == "Reality")
reality
tvshows[ reality, ]

# Exploratory Data Analysis

```{r, echo=FALSE, eval = T, out.width = '40%', fig.align='center'}
knitr::include_graphics("../lec_figs/data-science-explore.png")
```

- In data visualization, you'll learn the basic structure of a `ggplot` plot. It turns data into plots.
  
- In data transformation, you'll learn the key verbs that allow you to select important variables, filter out key observations, create new variables, and compute summaries.

- In **exploratory data analysis**, you'll combine visualization and transformation with your curiosity and skepticism to ask and answer interesting questions about data.

# Data Visualization - First Steps

```{r}
library(tidyverse)   # library(ggplot2) if tidyverse is not available
mpg
?mpg
```

- The `mpg` data frame, provided by `ggplot2`, contains observations collected by the US Environmental Protection Agency on 38 models of car.

- Q. Do cars with big engines use more fuel than cars with small engines?
  - `displ`: a car's engine size, in liters.
  - `hwy`: a car's fuel efficiency on the highway, in miles per gallon (mpg). 


---
# Data Visualization - First Steps
### <p style="color:#00449E"> Creating a `ggplot` </p>

-  What does the relationship between engine size and fuel efficiency look like?

  - To plot `mpg`, run the following code to put `displ` on the `x`-axis and `hwy` on the `y`-axis:

```{r}
ggplot(data = mpg) + 
  geom_point(mapping = aes(x = displ, y = hwy))
```



---
# Data Visualization - First Steps
### <p style="color:#00449E"> Graphing Template </p>
- To make a ggplot plot, replace the bracketed sections in the code below with a `data.frame`, a `geom` function, or a collection of mappings such as `x = VAR_1` and `y = VAR_2`.

```r
ggplot(data = <DATA>) + 
  <GEOM_FUNCTION>(mapping = aes(<MAPPINGS>))
```




---
# Data Visualization - First Steps
### <p style="color:#00449E"> Exercises </p>

- Run `ggplot(data = mpg)`. What do you see?
```r
ggplot(data = mpg)
```

- How many rows are in `mpg`? How many columns?

- What does the `drv` variable describe? Read the help for `?mpg` to find out.

- Make a scatterplot of `hwy` vs. `cyl`.

- What happens if you make a scatterplot of `class` vs. `drv`? Why is the plot not useful?

# Aesthetic Mappings

- An aesthetic is a visual property (e.g., `size`, `shape`, `color`) of the objects (e.g., `class`) in your plot.

- You can display a point in different ways by changing the values of its aesthetic properties.

  - Number of heads when flipping three coins 
  - Students’ grade level


- A **continuous variable** is a variable whose value is obtained by *measuring*.

# Aesthetic Mappings

- To set an aesthetic manually, set the aesthetic by name as an argument of your `geom_` function; i.e. it goes outside of `aes()`. 

  - You'll need to pick a level that makes sense for that aesthetic:

    - The name of a `color` as a *character string*.
  
    - The `size` of a point in *mm*.
  
    - The `shape` of a point as a *number*, as shown below.
  
```{r, echo=FALSE, eval = T, out.width = '60%', fig.align='center'}

### <p style="color:#00449E"> Specifying a `color` to the plot? </p>

```{r, echo = T, eval = F}
ggplot(data = mpg) +

# Common problems in ggplot()

- One common problem when creating `ggplot2` graphics is to put the `+` in the wrong place.

```{r, echo = T, eval = F}
ggplot(data = mpg) 
*+ geom_point( mapping = aes(x = displ, y = hwy) )
```

# Aesthetic Mappings
### <p style="color:#00449E"> Exercises </p>

- Which variables in mpg are categorical? Which variables are continuous? (Hint: type `?mpg` to read the documentation for the dataset). How can you see this information when you run `mpg`?

- Map a continuous variable to `color`, `size`, and `shape.` How do these aesthetics behave differently for categorical vs. continuous variables?

# Aesthetic Mappings
### <p style="color:#00449E"> Exercises </p>

- What happens if you map the same variable to multiple aesthetics?

- What does the stroke aesthetic do? What shapes does it work with? (Hint: use `?geom_point`)

- What happens if you map an aesthetic to something other than a variable name, like `aes(color = displ < 5)`? (Note, you'll also need to specify `x` and `y`).

# Facets 

- One way to add a variable, particularly useful for categorical variables, is to use **facets** to split your plot into facets, subplots that each display one subset of the data.

- To facet your plot by a single variable, use `facet_wrap()`.

```{r, echo = T, eval = F}
ggplot(data = mpg) + 
  geom_point(mapping = aes(x = displ, y = hwy)) + 
* facet_wrap(~ class, nrow = 2)
```





---
# Facets 

- To facet your plot on the combination of two variables, add `facet_grid()` to your plot call.

- The first argument of `facet_grid()` is also a formula. This time the formula should contain two variable names separated by a `~`.

```{r, echo = T, eval = F}
ggplot(data = mpg) + 
  geom_point(mapping = aes(x = displ, y = hwy)) + 
* facet_grid(drv ~ cyl)
```

# Facets
### <p style="color:#00449E"> Exercises </p>

- What happens if you facet on a continuous variable?

- What do the empty cells in plot with `facet_grid(drv ~ cyl)` mean? How do they relate to this plot?
```{r, echo = T, eval = F}
ggplot(data = mpg) + 
  geom_point(mapping = aes(x = drv, y = cyl))
```


- What plots does the following code make? What does `.` do?
```{r, echo = T, eval = F}
ggplot(data = mpg) + 
  geom_point(mapping = aes(x = displ, y = hwy)) +
* facet_grid(drv ~ .)

ggplot(data = mpg) + 
  geom_point(mapping = aes(x = displ, y = hwy)) +
* facet_grid(drv ~ .)

ggplot(data = mpg) + 
  geom_point(mapping = aes(x = displ, y = hwy)) +
* facet_grid(. ~ cyl)
```

# Facets
### <p style="color:#00449E"> Exercises </p>

- Take the first faceted plot in this section:
```{r, echo = T, eval = F}

ggplot(data = mpg) + 
  geom_point(mapping = aes(x = displ, y = hwy)) + 
  facet_wrap(~ class, nrow = 2)
```
  - What are the advantages to using faceting instead of the color aesthetic? What are the disadvantages? How might the balance change if you had a larger dataset?


---
# Facets
### <p style="color:#00449E"> Exercises </p>

- Read `?facet_wrap`. What does `nrow` do? What does `ncol` do? What other options control the layout of the individual panels? Why doesn’t `facet_grid()` have `nrow` and `ncol` arguments?

- When using `facet_grid`, you should usually put the variable with more unique levels in the columns. Why?

# Aesthetic Mappings and Facets
### <p style="color:#00449E"> Exercises </p>

- Use the following data.frame.

```{r}
tvshows_web <- read_csv(
		'https://bcdanl.github.io/data/tvshows.csv')
```

- Describe the relationship between audience size (`GRP`) and audience engagement (`PE`) using `ggplot`. Explain the relationship in words.
