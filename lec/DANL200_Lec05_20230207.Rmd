# Workflow
### <p style="color:#00449E"> Code and comment style </p>
- The two main principles for coding and managing data are:
  - Make things easier for your future self.
  - Don't trust your future self.

- The `#` mark is R's comment character.
  - `#` indicates that the rest of the line is to be ignored.
  - Write comments before the line that you want the comment to apply to.

- Consider using block commenting for separating code sections.
  - `####` defines a coding block.

- Break down long lines and long algebraic expressions.



---
# Workflow
### <p style="color:#00449E"> Quotation marks, parentheses, and `+` </p>


- Quotation marks and parentheses must always come in a pair.
  - If not, Console Pane will show you the continuation character `+`:

```{r, echo = T, eval = F}
x <- "hello
```

- The `+` tells you that R is waiting for more input; it doesn’t think you’re done yet. 


---
# Workflow
### <p style="color:#00449E"> Installing R packages </p>

- To install R package `PACKAGE`, use `install.packages("PACKAGE")`.
```{r, echo = T, eval = F}
install.packages("ggplot2")  # installing package "ggplot2"
install.packages("skimr")  # installing package "skimr"
```

- When the code is running, RStudio shows the STOP icon (`r fa("fas fa-stop", fill = "red")`) at the top right corner in the Console Pane.
  - Do not click it unless if you want to stop running the code.

```{r, echo=FALSE, eval = T, out.width = '90%', fig.align='center'}
knitr::include_graphics("../lec_figs/console-running.png")
```



---
# Workflow
### <p style="color:#00449E"> Loading R packages </p>

- To load R package `PACKAGE`, use `library(PACKAGE)`.
```{r, echo = T, eval = F}
library(skimr)  # loading package "skimr"
```


---
# Workflow
### <p style="color:#00449E"> `tidyverse` package </p>

- Check whether `tidyverse` is installed well:
```{r, echo = T, eval = F}
library(tidyverse)   # loading the package tidyverse
mpg  # data.frame provided by the package ggplot2
     # ggplot2 is included in tidyverse
```

- Please let me know if you have an error from the above code.
- If you could not install `tidyverse`, install and load the following R packages instead: `readr`, `ggplot2`, and `dplyr`.
```{r, echo = T, eval = F}
library(readr) # it allows us to use read_csv() and more
library(ggplot2) # it allows us to use ggplot() and more
library(dplyr) # it allows us to use glimpse() and more

# Exploratory Data Analysis

```{r, echo=FALSE, eval = T, out.width = '40%', fig.align='center'}
knitr::include_graphics("../lec_figs/data-science-explore.png")
```

- In data visualization, you'll learn the basic structure of a `ggplot` plot. It turns data into plots.
  
- In data transformation, you'll learn the key verbs that allow you to select important variables, filter out key observations, create new variables, and compute summaries.

- In **exploratory data analysis**, you'll combine visualization and transformation with your curiosity and skepticism to ask and answer interesting questions about data.



---
# Data Visualization - First Steps

```{r}
library(tidyverse)   # library(ggplot2) if tidyverse is not available
mpg
?mpg
```

- The `mpg` data frame, provided by `ggplot2`, contains observations collected by the US Environmental Protection Agency on 38 models of car.

- Q. Do cars with big engines use more fuel than cars with small engines?
  - `displ`: a car's engine size, in liters.
  - `hwy`: a car's fuel efficiency on the highway, in miles per gallon (mpg). 


---
# Data Visualization - First Steps
### <p style="color:#00449E"> Creating a `ggplot` </p>

-  What does the relationship between engine size and fuel efficiency look like?

  - To plot `mpg`, run the following code to put `displ` on the `x`-axis and `hwy` on the `y`-axis:

```{r}
ggplot(data = mpg) + 
  geom_point(mapping = aes(x = displ, y = hwy))
```



---
# Data Visualization - First Steps
### <p style="color:#00449E"> Graphing Template </p>
- To make a ggplot plot, replace the bracketed sections in the code below with a `data.frame`, a `geom` function, or a collection of mappings such as `x = VAR_1` and `y = VAR_2`.

```r
ggplot(data = <DATA>) + 
  <GEOM_FUNCTION>(mapping = aes(<MAPPINGS>))
```




---
# Data Visualization - First Steps
### <p style="color:#00449E"> Exercises </p>

- Run `ggplot(data = mpg)`. What do you see?
```r
ggplot(data = mpg)
```

- How many rows are in `mpg`? How many columns?

- What does the `drv` variable describe? Read the help for `?mpg` to find out.

- Make a scatterplot of `hwy` vs. `cyl`.

- What happens if you make a scatterplot of `class` vs. `drv`? Why is the plot not useful?

# Aesthetic Mappings

- In the plot below, one group of points (highlighted in red) seems to fall outside of the linear trend. 

```{r, echo=FALSE, eval = T, out.width = '50%', fig.align='center'}
knitr::include_graphics("../lec_figs/r4s_330_1.png")
```

  - How can you explain these cars? Are those hybrids?


---
# Aesthetic Mappings

- An aesthetic is a visual property (e.g., `size`, `shape`, `color`) of the objects (e.g., `class`) in your plot.

- You can display a point in different ways by changing the values of its aesthetic properties. 


```{r, echo=FALSE, eval = T, out.width = '50%', fig.align='center'}
knitr::include_graphics("../lec_figs/r4s_330_2.png")

# Aesthetic Mappings
### <p style="color:#00449E"> Discrete vs. Continuous Variables </p>

<!-- - A **variable** is a quantity whose value changes.  -->


- A **discrete variable** is a variable whose value is obtained by *counting*.
  - Number of students present
  - Number of red marbles in a jar
  - Number of heads when flipping three coins 
  - Students’ grade level


- A **continuous variable** is a variable whose value is obtained by *measuring*.
  - Height of students in class
  - Weight of students in class
  - Time it takes to get to school
  - Distance traveled between classes

# Aesthetic Mappings
### <p style="color:#00449E"> Specifying a `color` to the plot </p>

```{r, echo = T, eval = F}
ggplot(data = mpg) + 
  geom_point(mapping = aes(x = displ, y = hwy), 
*            color = "blue")
```



---
# Aesthetic Mappings

- To set an aesthetic manually, set the aesthetic by name as an argument of your `geom_` function; i.e. it goes outside of `aes()`. 

  - You'll need to pick a level that makes sense for that aesthetic:

    - The name of a `color` as a *character string*.
  
    - The `size` of a point in *mm*.
  
    - The `shape` of a point as a *number*, as shown below.
  
```{r, echo=FALSE, eval = T, out.width = '55%', fig.align='center'}
knitr::include_graphics("../lec_figs/r4s_330_3.png")
```



---
# Aesthetic Mappings
### <p style="color:#00449E"> Specifying a `color` to the plot? </p>

```{r, echo = T, eval = F}

  geom_point( mapping = aes(x = displ, y = hwy, 
*                           color = "blue") )
```




---
# Common problems in ggplot()

- One common problem when creating `ggplot2` graphics is to put the `+` in the wrong place.

```{r, echo = T, eval = F}
ggplot(data = mpg) 
*+ geom_point( mapping = aes(x = displ, y = hwy) )
```




---
# Aesthetic Mappings
### <p style="color:#00449E"> Exercises </p>

- Which variables in mpg are categorical? Which variables are continuous? (Hint: type `?mpg` to read the documentation for the dataset). How can you see this information when you run `mpg`?

- Map a continuous variable to `color`, `size`, and `shape.` How do these aesthetics behave differently for categorical vs. continuous variables?

---
# Aesthetic Mappings
### <p style="color:#00449E"> Exercises </p>

- What happens if you map the same variable to multiple aesthetics?

- What does the stroke aesthetic do? What shapes does it work with? (Hint: use `?geom_point`)

- What happens if you map an aesthetic to something other than a variable name, like `aes(color = displ < 5)`? (Note, you'll also need to specify `x` and `y`).


---
# Aesthetic Mappings
### <p style="color:#00449E"> Exercises </p>

- Provide both (1) ggplot() and (2) comments to describe the relationship between GDP per capita and life expectancy using `gapminder` data.

```{r}

# Facets
<html><div style='float:left'></div><hr color='#EB811B' size=1px width=796px></html>



---
# Facets 

- One way to add a variable, particularly useful for categorical variables, is to use **facets** to split your plot into facets, subplots that each display one subset of the data.

- To facet your plot by a single variable, use `facet_wrap()`.

```{r, echo = T, eval = F}
ggplot(data = mpg) + 
  geom_point(mapping = aes(x = displ, y = hwy)) + 
* facet_wrap(~ class, nrow = 2)
```





---
# Facets 

- To facet your plot on the combination of two variables, add `facet_grid()` to your plot call.

- The first argument of `facet_grid()` is also a formula. This time the formula should contain two variable names separated by a `~`.

```{r, echo = T, eval = F}
ggplot(data = mpg) + 
  geom_point(mapping = aes(x = displ, y = hwy)) + 
* facet_grid(drv ~ cyl)
```



---
# Facets
### <p style="color:#00449E"> Exercises </p>

- What happens if you facet on a continuous variable?

- What do the empty cells in plot with `facet_grid(drv ~ cyl)` mean? How do they relate to this plot?
```{r, echo = T, eval = F}
ggplot(data = mpg) + 
  geom_point(mapping = aes(x = drv, y = cyl))
```


- What plots does the following code make? What does `.` do?
```{r, echo = T, eval = F}
ggplot(data = mpg) + 
  geom_point(mapping = aes(x = displ, y = hwy)) +
* facet_grid(drv ~ .)

ggplot(data = mpg) + 
  geom_point(mapping = aes(x = displ, y = hwy)) +
* facet_grid(drv ~ .)

ggplot(data = mpg) + 
  geom_point(mapping = aes(x = displ, y = hwy)) +
* facet_grid(. ~ cyl)
```





---
# Facets
### <p style="color:#00449E"> Exercises </p>

- Take the first faceted plot in this section:
```{r, echo = T, eval = F}

ggplot(data = mpg) + 
  geom_point(mapping = aes(x = displ, y = hwy)) + 
  facet_wrap(~ class, nrow = 2)
```
  - What are the advantages to using faceting instead of the color aesthetic? What are the disadvantages? How might the balance change if you had a larger dataset?


---
# Facets
### <p style="color:#00449E"> Exercises </p>

- Read `?facet_wrap`. What does `nrow` do? What does `ncol` do? What other options control the layout of the individual panels? Why doesn’t `facet_grid()` have `nrow` and `ncol` arguments?

- When using `facet_grid`, you should usually put the variable with more unique levels in the columns. Why?



---
# Aesthetic Mappings and Facets
### <p style="color:#00449E"> Exercises </p>

- Use the following data.frame.

```{r}
tvshows_web <- read_csv(
		'https://bcdanl.github.io/data/tvshows.csv')
```

- Describe the relationship between audience size (`GRP`) and audience engagement (`PE`) using `ggplot`. Explain the relationship in words.

# Geometric Objects

- A `geom_*()` is the geometrical object that a plot uses to represent data.
  - Bar charts use `geom_bar()`;
  - Line charts use `geom_line()`; 
  - Boxplots use the `geom_boxplot()`; 
  - Scatterplots use the `geom_point()`; 
  - Fitted lines use the `geom_smooth()`;
  - and many more!

- We can use different `geom_*()` to plot the same data.

# Geometric Objects


- To change the geom in your plot, change the geom function that you add to `ggplot()`.

# Geometric Objects


- Every geom function in `ggplot2` takes a mapping argument.

- However, not every aesthetic works with every `geom`. 
  - You could set the `shape` of a point, but you couldn't set the `shape` of a line;
  - You could set the `linetype` of a line.


```{r, echo = T, eval = F}
ggplot( data = mpg ) + 
  geom_smooth( mapping = aes( x = displ, y = hwy, 
*                             linetype = drv) )
```


---
# Geometric Objects
- You can set the `group` aesthetic to a *categorical variable* to draw multiple objects. 

- `ggplot2` will draw a separate object for each unique value of the grouping variable. 


```{r, echo = T, eval = F}
ggplot(data = mpg) +
  geom_smooth(mapping = aes(x = displ, y = hwy))
              
ggplot(data = mpg) +
  geom_smooth(mapping = aes(x = displ, y = hwy, 
*                           group = drv))
```

---
# Geometric Objects
- In practice, `ggplot2` will automatically group the data for these `geoms` whenever you map an aesthetic to a discrete variable (as in the `linetype` example). 

```{r, echo = T, eval = F}
ggplot(data = mpg) +
  geom_smooth(
    mapping = aes(x = displ, y = hwy, 
*                 color = drv),
    show.legend = FALSE
  )
```





---
# Geometric Objects

- To display multiple geometric objects in the same plot, add multiple `geom_*()` functions to `ggplot()`:

```{r, echo = T, eval = F}
ggplot(data = mpg) + 
  geom_point(mapping = aes(x = displ, y = hwy)) +
  geom_smooth(mapping = aes(x = displ, y = hwy))
```



---
# Geometric Objects

- If you place mappings in a geom function, `ggplot2` will treat them as local mappings for the layer. 

```{r, echo = T, eval = F}
ggplot(data = mpg, 
*      mapping = aes(x = displ, y = hwy)) + 
  geom_point(mapping = aes(color = class)) + 
  geom_smooth()
```


---
# Geometric Objects

- You can use the same idea to specify different data for each layer. 
- Here, our smooth line displays just a subset of the `mpg` dataset, the `subcompact` cars. 

- The local data argument in `geom_smooth()` overrides the global data argument in `ggplot()` for that layer only.

```{r, echo = T, eval = F}
ggplot(data = mpg, 
       mapping = aes(x = displ, y = hwy)) + 
  geom_point(mapping = aes(color = class)) + 
  geom_smooth(data = filter(mpg, class == "subcompact"), 
              se = FALSE)
```

# Statistical Transformations


- Bar charts seem simple, but they are interesting because they reveal something subtle about plots. 

- Consider a basic bar chart, as drawn with `geom_bar()`. 

- The following bar chart displays the total number of diamonds in the `ggplot2::diamonds` dataset, grouped by `cut`. 

```{r, echo = T, eval = F}
ggplot(data = diamonds) + 
  geom_bar(mapping = aes(x = cut))
```

- The `diamonds` dataset comes in `ggplot2` and contains information about ~54,000 diamonds, including the `price`, `carat`, `color`, `clarity`, and `cut` of each diamond. 



---
# Statistical Transformations


- Many graphs, including bar charts, calculate new values to plot:

  - `geom_bar()`, `geom_histogram()`, and `geom_freqpoly()` bin your data and then plot bin counts, the number of observations that fall in each bin.
  
  - `geom_smooth()` fits a model to your data and then plot predictions from the model.
  
  - `geom_boxplot()` compute a summary of the distribution and then display a specially formatted box.



---
# Statistical Transformations


- The algorithm used to calculate new values for a graph is called a `stat`, short for statistical transformation. 

- The figure below describes how this process works with `geom_bar()`.

# Statistical Transformations

- There are three reasons you might need to use a `stat` explicitly:

  -  *1*. You might want to override the default stat. 

```{r, echo = T, eval = F}
demo <- tribble(         # for a simple data.frame
  ~cut,         ~freq,
  "Fair",       1610,
  "Good",       4906,
  "Very Good",  12082,
  "Premium",    13791,
  "Ideal",      21551 )

ggplot(data = demo) +
  geom_bar(mapping = aes(x = cut, y = freq), 
*          stat = "identity")
```

- There are three reasons you might need to use a `stat` explicitly:

  - *2*. You might want to override the default mapping from transformed variables to aesthetics. 


```{r, echo = T, eval = F}
ggplot(data = diamonds) + 
  geom_bar(mapping = aes(x = cut, y = stat(prop), 
*                        group = 1))

# Statistical Transformations
### <p style="color:#00449E"> Stat summary
- There are three reasons you might need to use a `stat` explicitly:

  - *3*. You might want to draw greater attention to the statistical transformation in your code.  


```{r, echo = T, eval = F}
ggplot(data = diamonds) + 
  stat_summary(
    mapping = aes(x = cut, y = depth),
    fun.min = min,
    fun.max = max,
    fun = median
  )
```

- What is the default geom associated with `stat_summary()`? How could you rewrite the previous plot to use that geom function instead of the stat function?

- What does `geom_col()` do? How is it different to `geom_bar()`?

- Most `geoms` and `stats` come in pairs that are almost always used in concert. Read through the documentation and make a list of all the pairs. What do they have in common?

- What variables does `stat_smooth()` compute? What parameters control its behavior?

- In our proportion bar chart, we need to set `group = 1`. Why? In other words what is the problem with these two graphs?

```{r, echo = T, eval = F}
ggplot(data = diamonds) + 
  geom_bar(mapping = aes(x = cut, y = stat(prop) ) )

ggplot(data = diamonds) + 
  geom_bar(mapping = aes(x = cut, y = stat(prop), 
*                        fill = color ) )
```
