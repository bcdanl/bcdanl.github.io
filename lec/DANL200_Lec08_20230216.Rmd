# Statistical Transformations


- Bar charts seem simple, but they are interesting because they reveal something subtle about plots. 

- Consider a basic bar chart, as drawn with `geom_bar()`. 

- The following bar chart displays the total number of diamonds in the `ggplot2::diamonds` dataset, grouped by `cut`. 

```{r, echo = T, eval = F}
ggplot(data = diamonds) + 
  geom_bar(mapping = aes(x = cut))
```

- The `diamonds` dataset comes in `ggplot2` and contains information about ~54,000 diamonds, including the `price`, `carat`, `color`, `clarity`, and `cut` of each diamond. 



---
# Statistical Transformations


- Many graphs, including bar charts, calculate new values to plot:

  - `geom_bar()`, `geom_histogram()`, and `geom_freqpoly()` bin our data and then plot bin counts, the number of observations that fall in each bin.
  
  - `geom_boxplot()` computes a summary of the distribution and then display a specially formatted box.
  
  - `geom_smooth()` fits a model to our data and then plot predictions from the model.



---
# Statistical Transformations


- The algorithm used to calculate new values for a graph is called a `stat`, short for statistical transformation. 

- The figure below describes how this process works with `geom_bar()`.


```{r, echo=FALSE, eval = T, warning=F, message=F, out.width = '100%', fig.align='center'}
knitr::include_graphics("../lec_figs/r4s_370_1.png")
```





---
# Statistical Transformations
### <p style="color:#00449E"> Observed Value vs. Number of Observations
- There are three reasons we might need to use a `stat` explicitly:

  -  *1*. We might want to override the default stat. 

```{r, echo = T, eval = F}
demo <- tribble(         # for a simple data.frame
  ~cut,         ~freq,
  "Fair",       1610,
  "Good",       4906,
  "Very Good",  12082,
  "Premium",    13791,
  "Ideal",      21551 )

ggplot(data = demo) +
  geom_bar(mapping = aes(x = cut, y = freq), 
*          stat = "identity")
```






---
# Statistical Transformations
### <p style="color:#00449E"> Count vs. Proportion
- There are three reasons we might need to use a `stat` explicitly:

  - *2*. We might want to override the default mapping from transformed variables to aesthetics. 


```{r, echo = T, eval = F}
ggplot(data = diamonds) + 
  geom_bar(mapping = aes(x = cut, y = stat(prop), 
*                        group = 1))
```


```{r, echo = T, eval = F}
ggplot(data = diamonds) + 
  geom_bar(mapping = aes(x = cut, y = stat(prop) ) )

ggplot(data = diamonds) + 
  geom_bar(mapping = aes(x = cut, y = stat(prop), 
*                        fill = color ) )
```

# Statistical Transformations
### <p style="color:#00449E"> Stat summary
- There are three reasons we might need to use a `stat` explicitly:

  - *3*. We might want to draw greater attention to the statistical transformation in our code.  


```{r, echo = T, eval = F}
ggplot(data = diamonds) + 
  stat_summary(
    mapping = aes(x = cut, y = depth),
    fun.min = min,
    fun.max = max,
    fun = median
  )
```








---
# Statistical Transformations
### <p style="color:#00449E"> Exercises

- What is the default geom associated with `stat_summary()`? How could you rewrite the previous plot to use that geom function instead of the stat function?

- What does `geom_col()` do? How is it different to `geom_bar()`?

- Most `geoms` and `stats` come in pairs that are almost always used in concert. Read through the documentation and make a list of all the pairs. What do they have in common?

- What variables does `stat_smooth()` compute? What parameters control its behavior?

# Position Adjustment
<html><div style='float:left'></div><hr color='#EB811B' size=1px width=796px></html>



---
# Position Adjustments
### <p style="color:#00449E"> `color` and `fill` aesthetic


- We can color a bar chart using either the `color` aesthetic, or, more usefully, `fill`:

.panelset[
.panel[.panel-name[`color`]

.pull-left[
```{r, echo = T, eval = F}
ggplot(data = diamonds) + 
  geom_bar(mapping = 
             aes(x = cut, 
*                [?] = cut))
```
]
.pull-right[
```{r, echo = F, eval = T}
ggplot(data = diamonds) + 
  geom_bar(mapping = aes(x = cut, 
                        color = cut))
```
]

]
.panel[.panel-name[`fill`]
.pull-left[
```{r, echo = T, eval = F}
ggplot(data = diamonds) + 
  geom_bar(mapping = 
             aes(x = cut, 
*                [?] = cut))
```
]
.pull-right[
```{r, echo = F, eval = T}
ggplot(data = diamonds) + 
  geom_bar(mapping = aes(x = cut, 
                        fill = cut))
```
]
]

]

---
# Position Adjustments
### <p style="color:#00449E"> Stacked bar charts with `fill` aesthetic


- Note that the bars are automatically stacked if we map the `fill` aesthetic to another variable.

.pull-left[
```{r, echo = T, eval = F}
ggplot(data = diamonds) + 
  geom_bar(mapping = 
             aes(x = cut, 
*                fill = clarity) )
```
]
.pull-right[
```{r, echo = F, eval = T}
ggplot(data = diamonds) + 
  geom_bar(mapping = aes(x = cut, 
                         fill = clarity) )
```
]


---
# Position Adjustments
### <p style="color:#00449E"> Stacked bar charts with `fill` aesthetic

- The `stack`ing is performed automatically by the **position adjustment** specified by the `position` argument. 

.pull-left[
```{r, echo = T, eval = F}
ggplot(data = diamonds) + 
  geom_bar(mapping = 
             aes(x = cut, 
                 fill = clarity),
*          position = "stack")
```
]
.pull-right[
```{r, echo = F, eval = T}
ggplot(data = diamonds) + 
  geom_bar(mapping = aes(x = cut, 
                        fill = clarity),
           position = "stack")
```
]




---
# Position Adjustments
### <p style="color:#00449E">  `position = "fill"` and `position = "dodge"`  

- If we don't want a stacked bar chart with counts, we can use one of two other `position` options: `fill` or `dodge`.


.panelset[

.panel[.panel-name[`position = "fill"`]

- `position = "fill"` works like stacking, but makes each set of stacked bars the same height. 

    - This makes it easier to compare proportions across groups.

```{r, echo = T, eval = F}
ggplot(data = diamonds) + 
  geom_bar(mapping = aes(x = cut, fill = clarity), position = [?])
```



] <!---->


.panel[.panel-name[`position = "dodge"`]

- `position = "dodge"` places overlapping objects directly beside one another. 

```{r, echo = T, eval = F}
ggplot(data = diamonds) + 
  geom_bar(mapping = aes(x = cut, fill = clarity), position = [?])
```

] <!---->

# Position Adjustments
### <p style="color:#00449E"> Overplotting and `position = "jitter"`

- The values of `hwy` and `displ` are rounded so the points appear on a grid and many points overlap each other. 
  - This problem is known as **overplotting**. 

- We can avoid the overlapping problem by setting the position adjustment to `jitter`. 
  - `position = "jitter"` adds a small amount of random noise to each point. 


```{r, echo = T, eval = F}
ggplot(data = mpg) + 
  geom_point(mapping = aes(x = displ, y = hwy), position = [?])
```





---
# Position Adjustments
### <p style="color:#00449E"> Exercises

- What is the problem with this plot? How could you improve it?

```{r, echo = T, eval = F}
ggplot(data = mpg, mapping = aes(x = cty, y = hwy)) + 
  geom_point()
```

- What parameters to `geom_jitter()` control the amount of jittering?

- Compare and contrast `geom_hex()` with `geom_count()`.

- What’s the default position adjustment for `geom_boxplot()`? Create a visualization of the `mpg` dataset that demonstrates it.

# Coordinate
<html><div style='float:left'></div><hr color='#EB811B' size=1px width=796px></html>



---
# Coordinate Systems

- The default coordinate system is the Cartesian coordinate system where the `x` and `y` positions act independently to determine the location of each point. 

- There are a number of other coordinate systems that are occasionally helpful.






---
# Coordinate Systems
### <p style="color:#00449E"> `coord_flip()`

- `coord_flip()` switches the `x` and `y` axes. 

- This is useful (for example), if we want horizontal boxplots. 

- It's also useful for long labels: it's hard to get them to fit without overlapping on the `x`-axis.

```{r, echo = T, eval = F}
ggplot(data = mpg, mapping = aes(x = class, y = hwy)) + 
  geom_boxplot()

ggplot(data = mpg, mapping = aes(x = class, y = hwy)) + 
  geom_boxplot() +
* coord_flip()
```





---
# Coordinate Systems
### <p style="color:#00449E"> `coord_fixed()`

- `coord_fixed()` fixes the ratio of length on the x and y axes.

```{r, echo = T, eval = F}
ggplot(data = mpg, 
       mapping = aes(x = cty, y = hwy)) + 
  geom_point() + geom_abline()

ggplot(data = mpg, 
       mapping = aes(x = cty, y = hwy)) + 
  geom_point() + geom_abline() +
*  coord_fixed()
```

-  Why is `coord_fixed()` important? What does `geom_abline()` do?

---
# Coordinate Systems
### <p style="color:#00449E"> `coord_quickmap()`

- `coord_quickmap()` sets the aspect ratio correctly for maps. 

```{r, echo = T, eval = F}
county <- map_data("county")   # Map data for US Counties
ny <- filter(county,      # We will discuss 'filter()' in the next chapter
             region == "new york")

ggplot(ny, aes(long, lat, group = group)) +
  geom_polygon(fill = "white", color = "black")

ggplot(ny, aes(long, lat, group = group)) +
  geom_polygon(fill = "white", color = "black") +
  coord_quickmap()
```

# The Layered Grammar of Graphics

- Let's add position adjustments, stats, coordinate systems, and faceting to our code template.


```{r, echo = T, eval = F}
ggplot(data = <DATA>) + 
  <GEOM_FUNCTION>(
     mapping = aes(<MAPPINGS>),
     stat = <STAT>, 
     position = <POSITION>) +
  <COORDINATE_FUNCTION> +
  <FACET_FUNCTION>
```

- The seven parameters---(1) a dataset, (2) a geom, (3) a set of mappings, (4) a stat, (5) a position adjustment, (6) a coordinate system, and (7) a faceting scheme---in the template compose the **grammar of graphics**, a formal system for building plots.

# Exploratory Data Analysis 
### <p style="color:#00449E">  </p>

- Here we discuss how to use summary statistics and visualization to explore your data in a systematic way, a task that statisticians call **exploratory data analysis** (EDA). 


- EDA is an iterative cycle. We:
  - Generate questions about your data.
  - Search for answers by visualizing, transforming, and modelling our data.
  - Use what we learn to refine our questions and/or generate new questions.
  
- Here, we focus on the visualization part.

# Exploratory Data Analysis 
### <p style="color:#00449E"> Tidy `data.frame` </p>

```{r, echo=FALSE, eval = T, warning=F, message=F, out.width = '90%', fig.align='center'}
knitr::include_graphics("../lec_figs/tidy-1.png")
```

- In a tidy `data.frame`,
  - A **variable** is in a column.
  - An **observation** is in a row. 
  - A **value** are in a cell.


---
# Exploratory Data Analysis 
### <p style="color:#00449E"> Tidy `data.frame` </p>

- A **variable** is a quantity, quality, or property that we can measure/count.
  
  
- An **observation** is a set of measurements made under similar conditions (e.g, similar unit of entity, time, and/or geography).
  - We usually make all of the measurements in an observation at the same time and on the same object.
  - An observation will contain several values, each associated with a different variable.
  - We sometimes refer to an observation as a data point.


- The **value** of a variable may change from measurement to measurement.


---
# Exploratory Data Analysis 
### <p style="color:#00449E"> Categorical/Discrete vs. Continuous Variables </p>


- A **discrete/categorical variable** is a variable whose value is obtained by *counting* and is whole numbers.
  - Number of red marbles in a jar
  - Number of heads when flipping three coins 
  - Students’ letter grade
  - US state/county


- A **continuous variable** is a variable whose value is obtained by *measuring*  and can have a decimal or fractional value.
  - Height/weight of students
  - Time it takes to get to school
  - Fuel efficiency of a vehicle (e.g., miles per gallon)

# Exploratory Data Analysis 
### <p style="color:#00449E"> Making Discoveries from a Data Set </p>

.panelset[

.panel[.panel-name[Distribution]
- What type of **variation** occurs within a variable?


- **Variation** is the tendency of the values of a variable to change from measurement to measurement. 
  - We can see variation easily in real life; if we measure any continuous variable twice, we will be likely to get two different values.
  - Which values are the most common? Why?
  - Which values are rare? Why? Does that match your expectations?
  - Can we see any unusual patterns? What might explain them?

]

.panel[.panel-name[Relationship]
- **Co-variation** is the tendency for the values of two or more variables to vary together in a related way. 


- What type of **co-variation** occurs between variables?

]

.panel[.panel-name[Steps]

- Figure out whether variables of interests are categorical or continuous.

- Think which geometric objects, aesthetic mappings, and faceting are appropriate to visualize distributions and relationships.

- If needed, transform a given `data.frame` (e.g., filtered observations, new variables, summarized data) and try new visualizations.

]

.panel[.panel-name[Geoms]

  - A distribution of a categorical variable (e.g., `geom_bar()` and more)
  - A distribution of a continuous variable (e.g., `geom_histogram()` and more)
  - A relationship between two categorical variables (e.g., `geom_bar()` and more)
  - A relationship between two continuous variables (e.g., `geom_point()` with `geom_smooth()` and more)
  - A relationship between a categorical variable and a continuous variable (e.g., `geom_boxplot()` and more)
  - A time trend of a categorical variable (e.g., `geom_bar()` and more)
  - A time trend of a continuous variable (e.g., `geom_line()` and more)
  
]

.panel[.panel-name[Summary Stat.]

- Use `skimr::skim(DATA.FRAME)` or `skimr::skim(DATA.FRAME$VARIABLE)` to know:

  - Mean (Average, Expected Value);
  
  - Standard Deviation (SD)
  
  - Minimum, First Quartile (Q1), Median (Q2), Third Quartile (Q3), and Maximum.
