# Statistical Transformations


- The algorithm used to calculate new values for a *ggplot* is called a `stat`, short for statistical transformation. 

- The figure below describes how this process works with `geom_bar()`.


```{r, echo=FALSE, out.width = '96%', fig.align='center'}
knitr::include_graphics("../lec_figs/r4s_370_1.png")
```



---
# Statistical Transformations

- Many graphs, including bar charts, calculate new values to plot:


.panelset[
.panel[.panel-name[histogram]
, `geom_histogram()` and `geom_freqpoly()` bin your data and then plot bin counts, the number of observations that fall in each bin.
.pull-left[
```{r, echo = T, eval = F}
ggplot(data = mpg,
       mapping = aes(x = hwy)) +
  geom_histogram(binwidth = 1, 
                 fill = NA, 
                 color = "blue") + 
  geom_freqpoly(binwidth = 1, 
                color = "red") 
```
]
.pull-right[
```{r, echo = F, eval = T}
ggplot(mpg, aes(x = hwy)) +
  geom_histogram(binwidth = 1, fill = NA, color = "blue") + 
  geom_freqpoly(binwidth = 1, color = "red") 
```
]
]

.panel[.panel-name[density function]
- `geom_density()` plots a probability density function.
  - The area under the density plot is re-scaled to equal one.
  - We can think of a density plot as a continuous histogram of a variable.
.pull-left[
```{r, echo = T, eval = F}
ggplot(data = mpg,
       mapping = 
         aes(x = hwy)) +
  geom_density() 
```
]
.pull-right[
```{r, echo = F, eval = T}
ggplot(data = mpg,
       mapping = aes(x = hwy)) +
  geom_density() 
```
]
]

.panel[.panel-name[bar chart]
`geom_bar()` is a histogram for discrete data.

.pull-left[
```{r, echo = T, eval = F}
ggplot(data = diamonds) + 
  geom_bar(mapping = 
             aes(x = cut))
```
]
.pull-right[
```{r, echo = F, eval = T}
ggplot(data = diamonds) + 
  geom_bar(mapping = 
             aes(x = cut))
```
]

]

.panel[.panel-name[boxplot]
- `geom_boxplot()` compute a summary of the distribution and then display a specially formatted box.

.pull-left[
```{r, echo = T, eval = F}
ggplot(data = diamonds) + 
  geom_boxplot(mapping = 
                 aes(x = cut, 
                     y = price))
```
]
.pull-right[
```{r, echo = F, eval = T}
ggplot(data = diamonds) + 
  geom_boxplot(mapping = 
                 aes(x = cut, y = price))
```
]
]
.panel[.panel-name[fitted line]
- `geom_smooth()` fits a model to your data and then plot predicted values of `y` from the model.

.pull-left[
```{r, echo = T, eval = F}
ggplot(data = mpg, mapping = 
         aes(x = hwy, y = cty)) + 
  geom_point(alpha = .25) +
  geom_smooth(method = lm, 
              color = 'red') +
  geom_smooth(linetype = 2, 
              se = FALSE)
```
]
.pull-right[
```{r, echo = F, eval = T, message = F, warning = F}
ggplot(data = mpg, 
       mapping = aes(x = hwy, y = cty)) + 
  geom_point(alpha = .25) +
  geom_smooth(method = lm, 
              color = 'red') +
  geom_smooth(linetype = 2, se = FALSE)
```

# Statistical Transformations
### <p style="color:#00449E"> Observed Value vs. Number of Observations
- There are three reasons we might need to use a `stat` explicitly:

  -  *1*. We might want to override the default `stat`. 

```{r, echo = T, eval = F}
demo <- tribble(         # for a simple data.frame
  ~cut,         ~freq,
  "Fair",       1610,
  "Good",       4906,
  "Very Good",  12082,
  "Premium",    13791,
  "Ideal",      21551 )

ggplot(data = demo) +
  geom_bar(mapping = aes(x = cut, y = freq), 
*          stat = "identity")
```






---
# Statistical Transformations
### <p style="color:#00449E"> Count vs. Proportion
- There are three reasons we might need to use a `stat` explicitly:

  - *2*. We might want to override the default mapping from transformed variables to aesthetics. 


```{r, echo = T, eval = F}
ggplot(data = diamonds) + 
  geom_bar(mapping = aes(x = cut, 
*                        y = after_stat(prop), 
                         group = 1))
```




---
# Statistical Transformations
### <p style="color:#00449E"> Stat summary
- There are three reasons we might need to use a `stat` explicitly:

  - *3*. We might want to draw greater attention to the statistical transformation in our code.  


```{r, echo = T, eval = F}
ggplot(data = diamonds) + 
* stat_summary(
    mapping = aes(x = cut, y = depth),
    fun = median,
    fun.min = min,
    fun.max = max
  )
```



---
# Statistical Transformations
### <p style="color:#00449E"> Exercises

- What is the default geom associated with `stat_summary()`? How could you rewrite the previous plot to use that geom function instead of the stat function?

- What does `geom_col()` do? How is it different to `geom_bar()`?

- Most `geoms` and `stats` come in pairs that are almost always used in concert. Read through the documentation and make a list of all the pairs. What do they have in common?

- What variables does `stat_smooth()` compute? What parameters control its behavior?


---
# Statistical Transformations
### <p style="color:#00449E"> Exercises

- In our proportion bar chart, we need to set `group = 1`. Why? In other words what is the problem with these two graphs?

```{r, echo = T, eval = F}
ggplot(data = diamonds) + 
  geom_bar(mapping = aes(x = cut, y = stat(prop) ) )

ggplot(data = diamonds) + 
  geom_bar(mapping = aes(x = cut, y = stat(prop), 
*                        fill = color ) )
```

---
# Position Adjustments
### <p style="color:#00449E"> `color` and `fill` aesthetic


- We can color a bar chart using either the `color` aesthetic, or, more usefully, `fill`:

.panelset[
.panel[.panel-name[`color`]

.pull-left[
```{r, echo = T, eval = F}
ggplot(data = diamonds) + 
  geom_bar(mapping = 
             aes(x = cut, 
*                [?] = cut))
```
]
.pull-right[
```{r, echo = F, eval = T}
ggplot(data = diamonds) + 
  geom_bar(mapping = aes(x = cut, 
                        color = cut))
```
]

]
.panel[.panel-name[`fill`]
.pull-left[
```{r, echo = T, eval = F}
ggplot(data = diamonds) + 
  geom_bar(mapping = 
             aes(x = cut, 
*                [?] = cut))
```
]
.pull-right[
```{r, echo = F, eval = T}
ggplot(data = diamonds) + 
  geom_bar(mapping = aes(x = cut, 
                        fill = cut))
```
]
]

]

---
# Position Adjustments
### <p style="color:#00449E"> Stacked bar charts with `fill` aesthetic


- Note that the bars are automatically stacked if we map the `fill` aesthetic to another variable.

.pull-left[
```{r, echo = T, eval = F}
ggplot(data = diamonds) + 
  geom_bar(mapping = 
             aes(x = cut, 
*                fill = clarity) )
```
]
.pull-right[
```{r, echo = F, eval = T}
ggplot(data = diamonds) + 
  geom_bar(mapping = aes(x = cut, 
                         fill = clarity) )
```
]


---
# Position Adjustments
### <p style="color:#00449E"> Stacked bar charts with `fill` aesthetic

- The `stack`ing is performed automatically by the **position adjustment** specified by the `position` argument. 

.pull-left[
```{r, echo = T, eval = F}
ggplot(data = diamonds) + 
  geom_bar(mapping = 
             aes(x = cut, 
                 fill = clarity),
*          position = "stack")
```
]
.pull-right[
```{r, echo = F, eval = T}
ggplot(data = diamonds) + 
  geom_bar(mapping = aes(x = cut, 
                        fill = clarity),
           position = "stack")
```
]




---
# Position Adjustments
### <p style="color:#00449E">  `position = "fill"` and `position = "dodge"`  

- If we don't want a stacked bar chart with counts, we can use one of two other `position` options: `fill` or `dodge`.


.panelset[

.panel[.panel-name[`position = "fill"`]

- `position = "fill"` works like stacking, but makes each set of stacked bars the same height. 

    - This makes it easier to compare proportions across groups.

```{r, echo = T, eval = F}
ggplot(data = diamonds) + 
  geom_bar(mapping = aes(x = cut, fill = clarity), position = [?])
```



] <!---->


.panel[.panel-name[`position = "dodge"`]

- `position = "dodge"` places overlapping objects directly beside one another. 

```{r, echo = T, eval = F}
ggplot(data = diamonds) + 
  geom_bar(mapping = aes(x = cut, fill = clarity), position = [?])
```

] <!---->

]

# Position Adjustments
### <p style="color:#00449E"> Overplotting and `position = "jitter"`

- The values of `hwy` and `displ` are rounded so the points appear on a grid and many points overlap each other. 
  - This problem is known as **overplotting**. 

- We can avoid the overlapping problem by setting the position adjustment to `jitter`. 
  - `position = "jitter"` adds a small amount of random noise to each point. 


```{r, echo = T, eval = F}
ggplot(data = mpg) + 
  geom_point(mapping = aes(x = displ, y = hwy), position = [?])
```





---
# Position Adjustments
### <p style="color:#00449E"> Exercises

- What is the problem with this plot? How could you improve it?

```{r, echo = T, eval = F}
ggplot(data = mpg, mapping = aes(x = cty, y = hwy)) + 
  geom_point()
```

- What parameters to `geom_jitter()` control the amount of jittering?

- Compare and contrast `geom_jitter()` with `geom_count()`.

- What’s the default position adjustment for `geom_boxplot()`? Create a visualization of the `mpg` dataset that demonstrates it.

# Coordinate
<html><div style='float:left'></div><hr color='#EB811B' size=1px width=796px></html>



---
# Coordinate Systems

- The default coordinate system is the Cartesian coordinate system where the `x` and `y` positions act independently to determine the location of each point. 

- There are a number of other coordinate systems that are occasionally helpful.






---
# Coordinate Systems
### <p style="color:#00449E"> `coord_flip()`

- `coord_flip()` switches the `x` and `y` axes. 

- This is useful (for example), if we want horizontal boxplots. 

- It's also useful for long labels: it's hard to get them to fit without overlapping on the `x`-axis.

```{r, echo = T, eval = F}
ggplot(data = mpg, mapping = aes(x = class, y = hwy)) + 
  geom_boxplot()

ggplot(data = mpg, mapping = aes(x = class, y = hwy)) + 
  geom_boxplot() +
* coord_flip()
```






---
# Coordinate Systems
### <p style="color:#00449E"> `coord_quickmap()`

- `coord_quickmap()` sets the aspect ratio correctly for maps. 

```{r, echo = T, eval = F}
county <- map_data("county")   # Map data for US Counties
ny <- filter(county,      # We will discuss 'filter()' in the next chapter
             region == "new york")

ggplot(ny, aes(long, lat, group = group)) +
  geom_polygon(fill = "white", color = "black")

ggplot(ny, aes(long, lat, group = group)) +
  geom_polygon(fill = "white", color = "black") +
  coord_quickmap()
```


---
# Coordinate Systems
### <p style="color:#00449E"> Exercises

- What does `labs()` do? Read the documentation.

- What does the plot below tell you about the relationship between city and highway mpg? Why is `coord_fixed()` important? What does `geom_abline()` do?

```{r, echo = T, eval = F}
ggplot(data = mpg, mapping = aes(x = cty, y = hwy)) +
  geom_point() + 
  geom_abline() +
  coord_fixed()

# The Layered Grammar of Graphics


- Let's add position adjustments, stats, coordinate systems, and faceting to our code template.


```{r, echo = T, eval = F}
ggplot(data = <DATA>) + 
  <GEOM_FUNCTION>(
     mapping = aes(<MAPPINGS>),
     stat = <STAT>, 
     position = <POSITION>) +
  <COORDINATE_FUNCTION> +
  <FACET_FUNCTION>
```

- The seven parameters---(1) a dataset, (2) a geom, (3) a set of mappings, (4) a stat, (5) a position adjustment, (6) a coordinate system, and (7) a faceting scheme---in the template compose the **grammar of graphics**, a formal system for building plots.
