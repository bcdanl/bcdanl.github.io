# The Layered Grammar of Graphics


- Let's add position adjustments, stats, coordinate systems, and faceting to our code template.


```{r, echo = T, eval = F}
ggplot(data = <DATA>) + 
  <GEOM_FUNCTION>(
     mapping = aes(<MAPPINGS>),
     stat = <STAT>, 
     position = <POSITION>) +
  <COORDINATE_FUNCTION> +
  <FACET_FUNCTION>
```

- The seven parameters---(1) a dataset, (2) a geom, (3) a set of mappings, (4) a stat, (5) a position adjustment, (6) a coordinate system, and (7) a faceting scheme---in the template compose the **grammar of graphics**, a formal system for building plots.

# Exploraty Data Analysis
### <p style="color:#00449E"> Get to know data before modeling

- Through exploratory data analysis (EDA), ...
  - We generate questions about our data.
  - We search for answers by visualizing and transforming our data.
  - We use what we learn to refine our questions and/or generate new questions.
  
  
- EDA and statistical analysis are an iterative cycle to answer questions we identify from data.


- EDA uses a combination of ...
  - Summary statistics
  - Visualization
  - Data transformation


---
# Exploraty Data Analysis
### <p style="color:#00449E"> Example

- Suppose our goal is to identify what kind of characteristics of customers determine customers' health insurance status.

- We've collected a dataset of customers whose health insurance status we know. 
  
- We've also identified some customer properties that we believe help predict the probability of insurance coverage: 
  - age
  - employment status
  - income
  - information about residence and vehicles, and so on

# Summary Statistics

<html><div style='float:left'></div><hr color='#EB811B' size=1px width=796px></html>


---
# Summary Statistics

- Use the `summary()` or `skimr::skim()` command to take our first look at the data.
  - They report a variety of summary statistics on the numerical variables of the data frame, and count statistics on any categorical variables.

```{r, echo = T, eval = F}
library(tidyverse)
library(skimr)
path_web <- "https://bcdanl.github.io/data/custdata.csv"
customer_data <- read_csv(path_web)
skim(customer_data)
```





---
# Summary Statistics
### <p style="color:#00449E"> Typical problems revealed by data summaries

- At this stage, we're looking for several common issues:
  - Missing values
  - Invalid values and outliers
  - Data ranges that are too wide or too narrow
  - The units of the data
  

- In general, the goal of EDA/modeling is to make good predictions on *typical* cases, or to identify causal relationships.
  - A model that is highly skewed to predict a rare case correctly may not always be the best model overall.



---
# Summary Statistics
### <p style="color:#00449E"> Missing values

- The variable `is_employed` is missing for more than a third of the data.

  - Why?

```{r, echo = T, eval = F}
## is_employed
## FALSE: 2321
## TRUE :44887
## NA's :24333
```


---
# Summary Statistics
### <p style="color:#00449E"> Data range and variation
- We should pay attention to how much the values in the data vary. 

  - Outliers are data points that fall well out of the range of where we expect the data to be.

```{r, echo = T, eval = F}
skim(customer_data$income)
skim(customer_data$age)
```



---
# Summary Statistics
### <p style="color:#00449E"> Units

- We may not know that variable `IncomeK` is defined as 

$$IncomeK = \text{customer\_data}\$income/1000.$$ 

- Looking only at the summary, the values could plausibly be interpreted to mean either "hourly wage" or "yearly income in units of $1,000."

```{r, echo = T, eval = F}
IncomeK <- customer_data$income/1000
skim(IncomeK)
```


- This is actually something that we’ll catch by checking data definitions in *data dictionaries or documentation*, rather than in the summary statistics.

# Key Points in Visualization

1. A graphic should display as much information as it can, with the lowest possible cognitive strain to the viewer.

2. Strive for clarity. Make the data stand out. Specific tips for increasing clarity include these:
    - Avoid too many superimposed elements, such as too many curves in the
      same graphing space.
    - Find the right aspect ratio and scaling to properly bring out the details of the
      data.
    - Avoid having the data all skewed to one side or the other of our graph.

3. Visualization is an iterative process. Its purpose is to answer questions about the data.

### <p style="color:#00449E"> Visually checking distributions for a single variable

- We will look at histograms, density plots, bar charts, and dot plots to see how varying a variable is.
- The above visualizations help us answer questions like these:

  - What is the peak value of the distribution?
  
  - How many peaks are there in the distribution (unimodality versus bimodality)?
  
  - How *normal* is the data? 
  
  - How much does the data vary? Is it concentrated in a certain interval or in a certain category?



---
# Visualization
### <p style="color:#00449E"> Visually checking distributions for a single variable

- One of the things that’s easy to grasp visually is the shape of the distribution of variable. 

```{r, echo = T, eval = F}
ggplot(data = customer_data) + 
  geom_density( mapping = aes(x = age) ) 
```

- The graph here is somewhat flattish between the ages of about 25 and about 60, falling off slowly after 60. 
- There seems to be a peak at around the late-20s to early 30s range, and another in the early 50s. 
- This data has multiple peaks: it is not unimodal.
  - Distribution peaks around mid/late 20s. Peaks again in early 50s.

knitr::include_graphics("../lec_figs/pds_3_4.png")
```

# Visualization
### <p style="color:#00449E"> Histograms

- A basic histogram bins a variable into fixed-width buckets and returns the number of data points that fall into each bucket as a height.

- A histogram tells us where our data is concentrated. It also visually highlights outliers and anomalies.


```{r, echo = T, eval = F}
ggplot( data = customer_data, aes(x=gas_usage) ) +
  geom_histogram( binwidth = 10, fill = "gray" )
  
skim(customer_data$gas_usage)
```

- When using `geom_histogram()/geom_freqpoly`, we should try several times with different values for `binwidth` or `bins`.

---
# Visualization
### <p style="color:#00449E"> Data dictionary entry for `gas_usage`


```{r, echo=FALSE, out.width = '50%', fig.align='center'}
knitr::include_graphics("../lec_figs/pds_tab_3_1.png")
```

- Treat values `001`, `002`, and `003` as numerical values could potentially lead to incorrect conclusions in our analysis.


---
# Visualization
### <p style="color:#00449E"> Density plots

- We can think of a density plot as a continuous histogram of a variable.

  - The area under the density plot is re-scaled to equal one.
  - We can think of a density plot as a continuous histogram of a variable.


```{r, echo = T, eval = F}
ggplot(customer_data, aes( x = income ) ) +
  geom_density() 
```

# Visualization
### <p style="color:#00449E"> A Little Bit of Math for Logarithm

.panelset[

.panel[.panel-name[log functions]

- The logarithm function, $y = \log_{b}\,(\,x\,)$, looks like ....

```{r, echo=FALSE, out.width = '42%', fig.align='center'}
knitr::include_graphics("../lec_figs/logarithm_plots.png")
```
]

.panel[.panel-name[log examples]
- $\log_{10}\,(\,100\,)$: the base $10$ logarithm of $100$ is $2$, because $10^{2} = 100$

- $\log_{e}\,(\,x\,)$: the base $e$ logarithm is called the natural log, where $e = 2.718\cdots$ is the mathematical constant,  the Euler's number.

- $\log\,(\,x\,)$ or $\ln\,(\,x\,)$: the natural log of $x$ .

- $\log_{e}\,(\,7.389\cdots\,)$: the natural log of $7.389\cdots$ is $2$, because $e^{2} = 7.389\cdots$.
]

]

# Visualization
### <p style="color:#00449E"> Log Transformation

- We should use a logarithmic scale when percent change, or change in orders of magnitude, is more important than changes in absolute units.

  - For small changes in variable $x$ from $x_{0}$ to $x_{1}$, the following can be shown: 
  
$$\Delta \log(x) \,= \, \log(x_{1}) \,-\, \log(x_{0}) 
\approx\, \frac{x_{1} \,-\, x_{0}}{x_{0}} 
\,=\, \frac{\Delta\, x}{x_{0}}.$$

- A difference in income of $5,000 means something very different across people with different income levels.

<!-- - For small changes in $y$, the following can be shown that -->

<!-- $$\Delta\,\\log(y)&\,=\, \\log(y_{1}) \,-\, \\log(y_{0}) \\ -->
<!-- &\approx\, \frac{y_{1}} \,-\, y_{0}}{y_{0}} \\ -->
<!-- &=\, \frac{\Delta\, y}{y_{0}}.$$ -->

  - We should also consider using a log scale to reduce a variance of residuals when a variable is heavily skewed.

---
# Visualization
### <p style="color:#00449E"> Log Transformation

- The log transformation makes the skewed distribution of income more normal.

```{r, echo = T, eval = F}
ggplot(customer_data, aes( x = income ) ) +
  geom_density() 

ggplot(customer_data, aes( x = log(income) ) ) +
  geom_density() 

ggplot(customer_data, aes( x = log10(income) ) ) +
  geom_density() 
```

# Visualization
### <p style="color:#00449E"> Bar Charts and Dotplots

- A bar chart is a histogram for discrete data.
  - It records the frequency of every value of a categorical variable.


```{r, echo = T, eval = F}
ggplot( data = customer_data, 
		    mapping =  aes( x = marital_status )  ) + 
  geom_bar( fill = "gray" )
```



---
# Visualization
### <p style="color:#00449E"> Bar Charts and Dotplots

- Bar charts are most useful when the number of possible values is fairly large, like state of residents.


```{r, echo = T, eval = F}
ggplot(customer_data, aes( x = state_of_res ) ) +
  geom_bar(fill = "gray") +
  coord_flip()
```

- A horizontal bar chart can be easier to read when there are several categories with long names.



---
# Visualization
### <p style="color:#00449E"> Bar Charts and Dotplots

- Sometimes it is better to sort the data when plotting a bar chart or dot plot.


```{r, echo = T, eval = F}
library(WVPlots)    # install.package("WVPlots") if you have not
ClevelandDotPlot(customer_data, "state_of_res",
                 sort = 1, title="Customers by state") +
  coord_flip()
```


- Sorted bar chart or dot plot can allow use to extract insight more efficiently from the data. 

---
# Visualization
### <p style="color:#00449E"> Visually checking relationships between two variables

- We'll often want to look at the relationship between two variables.

  - Is there a relationship between the two inputs---age and income---in my data?
  
  - If so, what kind of relationship, and how strong?
  
  - Is there a relationship between the input, marital status, and the output, health insurance? How strong?


---
# Visualization
### <p style="color:#00449E"> A relationship between age and income

- Reasonable age and income values can be selected.
  - We'll discuss the `filter()` function soon.

```{r, echo = T, eval = F}
customer_data2 <- filter(customer_data,
                         0 < age & age < 100 &  # 0 < age < 100
                         0 < income & income < 200000)   # 0 < income < 200000
                           
cor(customer_data$age, customer_data$income)
```



---
# Visualization
### <p style="color:#00449E"> A relationship between age and income

```{r, echo = T, eval = F}
ggplot( data = customer_data2 ) +
  geom_smooth( mapping = aes(x = age, y = income) )
  
ggplot(customer_data2, aes(x = age, y = income)) +
  geom_point() +
  geom_smooth() +

library(hexbin)    # install.packages("hexbin") if you have not.
ggplot(customer_data2, aes(x=age, y=income)) +
  geom_hex() +
  geom_smooth(color = "red", se = F) +
```



---
# Visualization
### <p style="color:#00449E"> A relationship between marital status and health insurance

- Bar charts can be used to describe a relationship between two categorical variables.


```{r, echo = T, eval = F}
ggplot(customer_data, aes(x = marital_status, fill = health_ins)) +
  geom_bar()

# side-by-side bar chart
ggplot(customer_data, aes(x = marital_status, fill = health_ins)) +
  geom_bar([?])
  
# stacked bar chart
ggplot(customer_data, aes(x = marital_status, fill = health_ins)) +
  geom_bar([?])
```



---
# Visualization
### <p style="color:#00449E"> The Distribution of Marriage Status across Housing Types

```{r, echo = T, eval = F}
cdata <- filter(customer_data, !is.na(housing_type))

ggplot(cdata, aes(x = housing_type, fill = marital_status)) +
  geom_bar(position = "dodge") +
  coord_flip()

ggplot(cdata, aes(x=marital_status)) +
  geom_bar(fill="darkgray") +
  facet_wrap(~housing_type, scale="free_x") +  # try without scale="free_x"
  coord_flip()
```
