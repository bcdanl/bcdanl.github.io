# Data Transformation

- It is rare that we get the data in exactly the right form we need.

- We'll need to create some new variables, summaries, rename the variables or reorder the observations in order to make the data a little easier to work with.

- We'll discuss how to transform data using the `dplyr` package and a dataset on flights departing New York City in 2013.


```{r, echo = T, eval = F}
library(tidyverse)
library(nycflights13)
head(flights)
View(flights) 
?flights
```



---
# Data Transformation
### <p style="color:#00449E"> `dplyr` basics </p>

- We are going to discuss the five key `dplyr` functions to solve various data manipulation challenges:
  - Pick observations by their values (`filter()`).
  - Reorder the rows (`arrange()`).
  - Pick variables by their names (`select()`).
  - Create new variables with functions of existing variables (`mutate()`).
  - Collapse many values down to a single summary (`summarise()`).



---
# Data Transformation
### <p style="color:#00449E"> `dplyr` basics </p>

- `filter(<DATA.FRAME>, LOGICAL_STATEMENT)`
- `arrange(<DATA.FRAME>, ...)`
- `select(<DATA.FRAME>, ...)`
- `mutate(<DATA.FRAME>, ...)`
- `summarise(<DATA.FRAME>, ...)`


- The first argument is a data frame.
- The subsequent arguments describe what to do with the data frame, using the variable names.
- The result is a new data frame.

# `filter()`
<html><div style='float:left'></div><hr color='#EB811B' size=1px width=796px></html>
  


---
# Filter rows with `filter()`

- `filter()` allows us to subset observations based on their values. 

```{r, echo = T, eval = F}
filter(flights, month == 1, day == 1)

jan1 <- filter(flights, month == 1, day == 1)

(dec25 <- filter(flights, month == 12, day == 25))
```



---
# Filter rows with `filter()`
### <p style="color:#00449E"> Comparisons


- R provides the standard comparison operators: `>`, `>=`, `<`, `<=`, `!=` (not equal), and `==` (equal).


```{r, echo = T, eval = F}
filter(flights, month = 1)

sqrt(2) ^ 2 == 2
1 / 49 * 49 == 1

near(sqrt(2) ^ 2,  2)
near(1 / 49 * 49, 1)
```


---
# Filter rows with `filter()`
### <p style="color:#00449E"> Logical Operators


- Multiple arguments to `filter()` are often combined with logical operators.


```{r, echo=FALSE, out.width = '66%', fig.align='center', fig.cap="Complete set of boolean operations in `R`"}
knitr::include_graphics("../lec_figs/transform-logical.png")
```




---
# Filter rows with `filter()`
### <p style="color:#00449E"> Logical Operators


- De Morgan’s law: 

- `!(x \& y)` is the same as `!x | !y`. 
- `!(x | y)` is the same as `!x & !y`.

- For example, comparison and logical operators can be used with `filter()` as follows:


```{r, echo = T, eval = F}
filter(flights, month == 11 | month == 12)
nov_dec <- filter(flights, month %in% c(11, 12))

filter(flights, !(arr_delay > 120 | dep_delay > 120))
filter(flights, arr_delay <= 120, dep_delay <= 120)
```



---
# Filter rows with `filter()`
### <p style="color:#00449E"> Missing values


- Almost any operation involving an unknown value will also be unknown.


```{r, echo = T, eval = F}
NA > 5
10 == NA
NA + 10
NA / 2

NA == NA
```




---
# Filter rows with `filter()`
### <p style="color:#00449E"> Missing values


- Let x be Mary's age. We don't know how old she is.
- Let y be John's age. We don't know how old he is.
- Are John and Mary the same age?


```{r, echo = T, eval = F}
x <- NA
y <- NA
x == y
```




---
# Filter rows with `filter()`
### <p style="color:#00449E"> Missing values


- If we want to determine if a value is missing, use `is.na()`.
- If we want to preserve missing values, ask `filter()` for them explicitly.


```{r, echo = T, eval = F}
x <- NA
is.na(x)

df <- tibble(y = c(1, NA, 3))
filter(df, y > 1)
filter(df, is.na(y) | y > 1)
```




---
# Filter rows with `filter()`
### <p style="color:#00449E"> Exercises

- Find all flights that
  - Had an arrival delay of two or more hours
  - Flew to Houston (`IAH` or `HOU`)
  - Were operated by United, American, or Delta
  - Departed in summer (July, August, and September)
  - Arrived more than two hours late, but didn’t leave late
  - Were delayed by at least an hour, but made up over 30 minutes in flight
  - Departed between midnight and 6am (inclusive)


---
# Filter rows with `filter()`
### <p style="color:#00449E"> Exercises

- Another useful `dplyr` filtering helper is `between()`. What does it do? Can you use it to simplify the code needed to answer the previous challenges?

- How many flights have a missing `dep_time`? What other variables are missing? What might these rows represent?

- Why is `NA^0` not missing? Why is `NA | TRUE` not missing? Why is `FALSE & NA` not missing? Can you figure out the general rule? (`NA * 0` is a tricky counterexample!)

# `arrange()`
<html><div style='float:left'></div><hr color='#EB811B' size=1px width=796px></html>


---
# Arrange rows with `arrange()`

- `arrange()` changes their order.

- If we provide more than one column name, each additional column will be used to break ties in the values of preceding columns.

- Use `desc()` to re-order by a column in descending order.


```{r, echo = T, eval = F}
arrange(flights, year, month, day)

# re-order observations by dep_delay in descending order.
arrange(flights, [?])
```


---
# Arrange rows with `arrange()`
### <p style="color:#00449E"> Exercises

- How could you use `arrange()` to sort all missing values to the start? (Hint: use `is.na()`).

- Sort flights to find the most delayed flights. Find the flights that left earliest.

- Sort flights to find the fastest (highest speed) flights.

- Which flights traveled the farthest? Which traveled the shortest?

# `select()`
<html><div style='float:left'></div><hr color='#EB811B' size=1px width=796px></html>


---
# Select columns with `select()`

- It’s not uncommon to get datasets with hundreds or even thousands of variables.
- `select()` allows us to narrow in on the variables we're actually interested in. 



```{r, echo = T, eval = F}
select(flights, year, month, day)

select(flights, year:day)

select(flights, -(year:day))
```



---
# Select columns with `select()`

- There are a number of helper functions we can use within `select()`:

- `starts_with("abc")`: matches names that begin with "abc".

- `ends_with("xyz")`: matches names that end with "xyz".

- `contains("ijk")`: matches names that contain "ijk".

- `num_range("x", 1:3)`: matches x1, x2 and x3.


---
# Select columns with `select()`
### <p style="color:#00449E"> Rename variables with `rename()`


- `rename()` can be used to rename variables:

  - `rename(<DATA>, <NEW_VARIABLE> = <EXISTING_VARIABLE>)`


```{r, echo = T, eval = F}
rename(flights, tail_num = tailnum)
```


---
# Select columns with `select()`
### <p style="color:#00449E"> Change the order of variables


- The function, `everything()`, can be used to move variables to the start of the data frame:


```{r, echo = T, eval = F}
select(flights, time_hour, air_time, [?])
```



---
# Select columns with `select()`
### <p style="color:#00449E"> Exercises

- Brainstorm as many ways as possible to select `dep_time`, `dep_delay`, `arr_time`, and `arr_delay` from flights.

- What happens if we include the name of a variable multiple times in a `select()` call?

- What does the `any_of()` function do? Why might it be helpful in conjunction with this vector?

```{r, echo = T, eval = F}
vars <- c("year", "month", "day", "dep_delay", "arr_delay")
```



---
# Select columns with `select()`
### <p style="color:#00449E"> Exercises

- Does the result of running the following code surprise us? How do the select helpers deal with case by default? How can we change that default?

```{r, echo = T, eval = F}
select(flights, contains("TIME"))
```



---
class: inverse, center, middle

# `mutate()`
<html><div style='float:left'></div><hr color='#EB811B' size=1px width=796px></html>

---
# Add new variables with `mutate()`


- `mutate()` is useful to add new columns that are functions of existing columns.


```{r, echo = T, eval = F}
flights_sml <- select(flights, 
                      year:day, 
                      ends_with("delay"), 
                      distance, 
                      air_time )

mutate(flights_sml,
  gain = dep_delay - arr_delay,
  speed = distance / air_time * 60 )

mutate(flights_sml,
  gain = dep_delay - arr_delay,
  hours = air_time / 60,
  gain_per_hour = gain / hours )
```



---
# Add new variables with `mutate()`
- If we only want to keep the new variables, use `transmute()`.


```{r, echo = T, eval = F}
transmute(flights,
  gain = dep_delay - arr_delay,
  hours = air_time / 60,
  gain_per_hour = gain / hours
)
```



---
# Add new variables with `mutate()`
### <p style="color:#00449E"> Useful creation functions

- There are many functions for creating new variables that we can use with `mutate()`.

- Arithmetic operators: `+`, `-`, `*`, `/`, `^`.
- Modular arithmetic: `%/%` (integer division) and `%%` (remainder).


```{r, echo = T, eval = F}
transmute(flights,
  dep_time,
  hour = dep_time %/% 100,
  minute = dep_time %% 100
)
```


---
# Add new variables with `mutate()`
### <p style="color:#00449E"> Useful creation functions

- There are many functions for creating new variables that we can use with `mutate()`.

- Offsets: `lead()` and `lag()` allow us to refer to leading or lagging values. 

- Cumulative and rolling aggregates: R provides functions for running sums, products, mins and maxes: `cumsum()`, `cumprod()`, `cummin()`, `cummax()`, and `cummean()`


```{r, echo = T, eval = F}
(x <- 1:10)
lag(x)
lead(x)
cumsum(x)
cummean(x)
```




---
# Add new variables with `mutate()`
### <p style="color:#00449E"> Useful creation functions

- There are many functions for creating new variables that we can use with `mutate()`.


- Ranking: `min_rank()`, `dense_rank()`, `row_number()`, , `percent_rank()`, and `cume_dist()`.



```{r, echo = T, eval = F}
rank_me <- tibble( x = c(10, 5, 1, 5, 5, NA) )
rank_me <- mutate(rank_me,
                  id_x = row_number(x),
                  x_min_rank = min_rank(x),
                  x_dense_rank = dense_rank(x) )
```





---
# Add new variables with `mutate()`
### <p style="color:#00449E"> Useful creation functions

- To create new variables based on a condition, we can use the `if_else()` and `ifelse()` functions. 
  - `if_else(<condition>, <if TRUE>, <else>)`
  - `ifelse(<condition>, <if TRUE>, <else>)`


```{r, echo = T, eval = F}
flight_season <-mutate(flights,
    summer_month = if_else(month %in% c(6, 7, 8), TRUE, FALSE))

flight_season <-mutate(flights,
    summer_month = if_else(month %in% c(6, 7, 8), TRUE, 0))

flight_season <-mutate(flights,   # ifelse() is less restrictive
    summer_month = ifelse(month %in% c(6, 7, 8), TRUE, 0))
```



---
# Add new variables with `mutate()`
### <p style="color:#00449E"> Exercises
 
- Currently `dep_time` and `sched_dep_time` are convenient to look at, but hard to compute with because they’re not really continuous numbers. Convert them to a more convenient representation of number of minutes since midnight.

- Compare `air_time` with `arr_time - dep_time`. What do you expect to see? What do you see? What do you need to do to fix it?

- Compare `dep_time`, `sched_dep_time`, and `dep_delay.` How would you expect those three numbers to be related?

- Find the 10 most delayed flights using a ranking function. How do you want to handle ties?
