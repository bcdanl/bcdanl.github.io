# Factors
### <p style="color:#00449E"> Creating factors

- In `R`, factors are categorical variables, variables that have a fixed and known set of possible values.

```{r, echo = T, eval = F}
x1 <- c("Dec", "Apr", "Jan", "Mar")
```

- Using a string to record variable `x1` has two problems:
  1. There are only twelve possible months, and there's nothing saving us from typos.
  2. It doesn't sort in a useful way.

```{r, echo = T, eval = F}
x2 <- c("Dec", "Apr", "Jam", "Mar")
sort(x1)
```


---
# Factors
### <p style="color:#00449E"> Creating factors with `factor()`

- We can fix both of these problems with `factor()`. 
- To create a factor, we must start by creating a list of the valid `levels`.
- Any values not in the set will be silently converted to `NA`.
- If we omit the `levels`, they'll be taken from the data in alphabetical order:

.pull-left[
```{r, echo = T, eval = F}
months <- c(
  "Jan", "Feb", "Mar", "Apr", 
  "May", "Jun", "Jul", "Aug", 
  "Sep", "Oct", "Nov", "Dec")
x1 <- 
  c("Dec", "Apr", "Jan", "Mar")
y1 <- factor(x1, 
             levels = months)
sort(y1)
```
]

.pull-right[
```{r, echo = T, eval = F}
x2 <- 
  c("Dec", "Apr", "Jam", "Mar")

y2 <- factor(x2, 
             levels = months)
y2

factor(x1)
```
]




---
# Factors
### <p style="color:#00449E"> Creating factors with `factor()`

-  Sometimes we'd prefer that the order of the levels match the order of the first appearance in the data. 

- We can do that when creating the factor by setting levels to `unique()`.

- If we ever need to access the set of valid levels directly, we can do so with `levels()`.

```{r, echo = T, eval = F}
x1

f1 <- factor(x1, levels = unique(x1))
f1

levels(f1)
```


---
# Factors
### <p style="color:#00449E"> General Social Survey

- We're going to focus on the data frame, `forcats::gss_cat`.which is a sample of data from the General Social Survey.

- When factors are stored in a data frame, we can see them with `count()`.

```{r, echo = T, eval = F}
gss_cat

gss_cat %>%
  [?](race)
```


---
# Factors
### <p style="color:#00449E"> Modifying factor order

- It's often useful to change the order of the factor levels in a visualization.

- Imagine we want to explore the average number of hours spent watching TV per day across `relig`:

.pull-left[
```{r, echo = T, eval = F}
relig_summary <- gss_cat %>%
  group_by([?]) %>%
  summarize(
    age = [?](age, [?]),
    tvhours = [?](tvhours, [?]),
    n = [?]
  )
```
]
.pull-right[
```{r, echo = T, eval = F}
ggplot(relig_summary, 
       aes(tvhours, relig)) + 
  [?]()
```
]



---
# Factors
### <p style="color:#00449E"> Modifying factor order

- We can reorder the levels using `fct_reorder(f, x, fun)`, which can take three arguments.

- `f`: the factor whose levels we want to modify.
- `x`: a numeric vector that we want to use to reorder the levels.
- Optionally, `fun`: a function that's used if there are multiple values of `x` for each value of `f`. The default value is *median*.




```{r, echo = T, eval = F}
relig_summary %>%
  mutate(relig = [?](relig, tvhours)) %>%
  ggplot(aes(tvhours, relig)) + [?]()
```





---
# Factors
### <p style="color:#00449E"> Modifying factor order

- We can use `relevel()` to set the first level (*reference level*). 
- `relevel(x, ref = ...)` takes at least the two arguments: 
  - `x`: factor variable 
  - `ref`: reference level or first level
  
.pull-left[
```{r, echo = T, eval = F}
rincome_summary <- gss_cat %>%
  group_by([?]) %>%
  summarize(
    age = [?](age, [?]),
    tvhours = [?](tvhours, [?]),
    n = [?]
  )
```

]

.pull-right[
```{r, echo = T, eval = F}
ggplot(rincome_summary, 
       aes(age, [?](rincome, age) ) )  + 
  geom_point()
ggplot(rincome_summary, 
       aes(age, 
           [?](rincome, 
               "Not applicable") ) ) +
  geom_point()
```

---
# Dates and times


- The `lubridate` package makes it easier to work with dates and times in `R`.

```{r, echo = T, eval = F}
library(tidyverse)
library(lubridate)
library(nycflights13)
```




---
# Dates and times
### <p style="color:#00449E"> Creating date/times

- To get the current date or date-time we can use `today()` or `now()`.
- The `lubridate` functions are a combination of y, m, d, h, m, and s.

.pull-left[
```{r, echo = T, eval = F}
today()
now()
```
]
.pull-right[
```{r, echo = T, eval = F}
ymd("2017-01-31")
[?]("January 31st, 2017")
[?]("31-Jan-2017")

[?](20170131)

[?]("2017-01-31 20:11:59")
[?]("01/31/2017 08:01")

[?](20170131, [?] = "UTC")
```
]



---
# Dates and times
### <p style="color:#00449E"> Creating date/times

- To create a date/time from individual components, use `make_date()` for dates, or `make_datetime()` for date-times:



```{r, echo = T, eval = F}
flights %>% 
  select(year, month, day, hour, minute)
  
flights %>% 
  select(year, month, day, hour, minute) %>% 
  mutate(departure = [?](year, month, day, hour, minute))
  
flights %>% 
  select(year, month, day, hour, minute) %>% 
  mutate(departure = [?](year, month, day))
```



---
# Dates and times
### <p style="color:#00449E"> Creating date/times

- We can visualize time series data using `lubridate` functions.

```{r, echo = T, eval = F}
flights_dt %>% 
  ggplot(aes(dep_time)) + 
  geom_freqpoly(binwidth = 86400) # 86400 seconds = 1 day
  
flights_dt %>% 
  filter(dep_time < ymd(20130102)) %>% 
  ggplot(aes(dep_time)) + 
  geom_freqpoly(binwidth = 600) # 600 s = 10 minutes
```




---
# Dates and times
### <p style="color:#00449E"> Creating date/times

- `as_datetime()` and `as_date()` switch between a date-time and a date.



```{r, echo = T, eval = F}
[?](today())
[?](now())
```

# Modeling Methods - Linear Regression
<html><div style='float:left'></div><hr color='#EB811B' size=1px width=796px></html>


---
# Linear Regression Methods
### <p style="color:#00449E"> Applications

- With linear regression, we can predict outcomes and infer relationships between variables:

  - AdWord valuation: how much the company should spend to buy certain AdWords on search engines

  - Estimating price elasticity (the rate at which a price increase will decrease sales, and vice versa) of various products or product classes

  - Predicting the probability that a loan will default
  
  - Inferring how much a marketing campaign will increase traffic or sales



---
# Linear Regression 
### <p style="color:#00449E"> 

- Linear regression is the fundamental method we should always try for our empirical analysis.

  - The predicted outcome;
  - The relationship between the explanatory variables and the outcome variable.
  
  
  
- Issues related to the linear regression methods include ...
  
  - **Colinearity**: too high correlation between the explanatory variables.
  - **Omitted variable bias**: bias in the model because of omitting important explanatory variables that are related with the existing explanatory variables.
  - **Selection bias**: bias in the model because of the *selection* of sample data does not properly represent the entire population.



---
# Linear Regression 
### <p style="color:#00449E">  Example

- Suppose we want to predict personal income based on how many years a person lives. 

  - In other words, for every person `i`, we want to predict `PINCP[i]` based on `AGEP[i]`.
  
- We also want to estimate how an increase in `AGEP[i]` is associated with `PINCP[i]`.

---
# Linear Regression 
### <p style="color:#00449E">  Linear Relationship

- Linear regression assumes that ...

  - The outcome `PINCP[i]` is linearly related to the input `AGEP[i]`:

$$\texttt{PINCP[i]} \;=\quad \texttt{b0} \,+\, \texttt{b1*AGEP[i]} \,+\, \texttt{e[i]}$$
where `e[i]` is a statistical error term.



---

```



---
# Linear Regression 
### <p style="color:#00449E">  Example

- Suppose we also want to estimate how gender will affect personal income. 
- Linear regression assumes that ...
  - The outcome `PINCP[i]` is linearly related to each of the inputs `AGEP[i]` and `SEX[i]`:

$$\texttt{PINCP[i]} \;=\quad \texttt{f(AGEP[i], SEX[i])} \,+\, \texttt{e[i]} \qquad\qquad\qquad\qquad\\
\;=\quad \texttt{b0} \,+\, \texttt{b1*AGEP[i]} \,+\, \texttt{b2*SEX[i]}\,+\, \texttt{e[i]}$$
- A variable on the left-hand side is called an outcome variable or a dependent variable.
- Variables on the right-hand side are called explanatory variables, independent variables, or input variables.
- Coefficients $\texttt{b[1]}, ... , \texttt{b[P]}\;$  on the right-hand side are called beta coefficients.




---
# Linear Regression 
### <p style="color:#00449E">  Goals of Linear Regression

-  The goals of linear regression are  ... 
  1. Find the estimated values of `b1` and `b2`: $\quad \hat{\texttt{b1}}$ and $\hat{\texttt{b2}}$.
  
  2. Make a prediction on `PINCP[i]` for each person `i`: $\quad \widehat{\texttt{PINCP}}\texttt{[i]}$.

$$\widehat{\texttt{PINCP}}\texttt{[i]} \;=\quad \hat{\texttt{b0}} \,+\, \hat{\texttt{b1}}\texttt{*AGEP[i]} \,+\, \hat{\texttt{b2}}\texttt{*SEX[i]}$$

- We will use the hat notation $(\,\hat{\texttt{ }}\,)$  to distinguish *estimated* beta coefficients and *predicted* outcomes from *true* values of beta coefficients and *true* values of outcome variables, respectively.

---
# Linear Regression 
### <p style="color:#00449E">  More Assumptions

- Assumptions on the linear regression model are that ...

  - The outcome variable is a linear combination of the explanatory variables.
  
  - Errors have a mean value of 0.
  
  - Errors are *uncorrelated* with explanatory variables.


---
# Linear Regression 
### <p style="color:#00449E"> Beta estimates

- Linear regression finds the beta coefficients $( \texttt{b[0]}, ... , \texttt{b[P]} )$ such that ...

  – The linear function $\texttt{f(x[i, ])}$ is as near as possible to
$\texttt{y[i]}$ for all $\texttt{(x[i, ], y[i])}$ pairs in the data.


- In other words, the estimator for the beta coefficients is chosen to minimize the sum of squares of the *residual errors* (SSR):

  -  $\texttt{Residual_Error[i] = y[i] - } \hat{\texttt{y}}\,\texttt{[i]}$.
  
  -  $\texttt{SSR} = \texttt{Residual_Error[1]}^{2} + \cdots + \texttt{Residual_Error[N]}^{2}$.




---
# Linear Regression 
### <p style="color:#00449E"> Example of Prediction

.pull-left[
- Linear regression often does an excellent job, even when the actual relation between $\texttt{x[i, ]}$ and $\texttt{y[i]}$ is not linear.

  - For example, $y = x^2\;$ vs. $\;f(x) = -22 + 11x$

# Linear Regression 
### <p style="color:#00449E"> Evaluating Models


- **Training data**: When we're building a model to make predictions or to identify the relationships, we need *data* to build the model.

- **Testing data**: We also need data to test whether the model works well on *new data*.

.pull-left[

- So, we split data into training and test sets when building a linear regression model.

# Linear Regression 
### <p style="color:#00449E"> A Little Bit of Statistics for the Uniform Distribution

.pull-left[

- The probability density function for the uniform distribution looks like:


- With the uniform distribution, any values of $x$ between 0 and 1 is equally likely drawn.

- `runif(n)` generates `n` uniform random numbers between 0 and 1.

.pull-right[

```{r, echo=FALSE, out.width = '75%', fig.align='center'}

# Linear Regression 
### <p style="color:#00449E"> Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

- Use summary statistics and visualization to explore the data, particularly for the following variables:

  - `PINCP`: personal income
  - `AGEP`: age 
  - `SEX`: sex


- It's often a better idea to get some sense of how the data behaves through EDA before doing any statistical analysis.

```{r, echo = T, eval = F}
install.packages("GGally")  # to use GGally::ggpairs()
ggpairs( select(dtrain, PINCP, AGEP, SEX) )  # for correlogram or correlation matrix

```
In the above line of R commands, ...
- `model`: R object to save the estimation result of linear regression
-  `lm()`: Linear regression modeling function
- `PINCP ~ AGEP + SEX`:  Formula for linear regression
- `PINCP`: Outcome/Dependent variable
- `AGEP, SEX`: Input/Independent/Explanatory variables
- `dtrain`: Data frame to use for training

# Linear Regression using **R**
### <p style="color:#00449E"> Indicator variables

- Linear regression handles a factor variable with `m` possible levels by converting it to `m-1` indicator variables, and the rest `1` category, the first level of the factor variable, becomes a reference level.


- The value of any indicator variable is either 0 or 1.

- E.g., the indicator variable, `SEXFemale`, is follows: 

$$
\texttt{SEXFemale[i] }\\
= \begin{cases}
\texttt{1} & \text{if a person } \texttt{i} \text{ is } \texttt{female};\\\\
\texttt{0} & \text{otherwise}.\qquad\qquad\quad\,
\end{cases}
$$

- The level `male` becomes a reference level when interpreting the beta estimate for `SEXFemale`.


---
# Linear Regression using **R**
### <p style="color:#00449E"> Setting a reference level

- If the independent variable includes factor variables, we can set a reference level for each factor variable using `relevel(VARIABLE, ref = "LEVEL")`.

.panelset[

.panel[.panel-name[code]
```{r, echo = T, eval= F}
dtrain$SEX, <- relevel(dtrain$SEX, ref = "Male") 

model <- lm(log(PINCP) ~ AGEP + SEX, 
            data = dtrain)
            
summary(model)
```
]

.panel[.panel-name[variable]

- E.g., the indicator variable, `SEXMale`, is follows: 

$$
\texttt{SEXMale[i] }\\
= \begin{cases}
\texttt{1} & \text{if a person } \texttt{i} \text{ is } \texttt{male};\\\\ 
\texttt{0} & \text{otherwise}.\qquad\qquad\quad
\end{cases}
$$

- The level `female` now becomes a reference level.

- Note: Changing the reference level does not change the regression result.

# Linear Regression using **R**
### <p style="color:#00449E"> Interpreting Estimated Coefficients

- What does it mean for a beta estimate $\hat{\texttt{b}}$ to be statistically significant at 5% level?

  - It means that the null hypothesis $H_{0}: \texttt{b} = 0$ is rejected for a given significance level 5%.
  
  - "2 standard error rule" of thumb: The true value of $\texttt{b}$ is 95% likely to be in the confidence interval $(\, \hat{\texttt{b}} - 2 * \texttt{Std. Error}\;,\; \hat{\texttt{b}} + 2 * \texttt{Std. Error} \,)$.
  
  - The standard error tells us how uncertain our estimate of the coefficient `b` is.
 
  - We should look for the stars!

# Linear Regression using **R**
### <p style="color:#00449E"> **R-squared**

- **R-squared** is a measure of how well the model “fits” the data, or its “goodness of fit.”
  - **R-squared** can be thought of as *what fraction of the `y`'s variation is explained by the independent variables*.
  
  
- **R-squared** will be higher for models with more explanatory variables, regardless of whether the additional explanatory variables actually improve the model or not.
- We want **R-squared** to be *fairly* large and **R-squareds** that are similar on testing and training.


- The adjusted **R-squared** is the multiple **R-squared** penalized for the number of input variables.

# Linear Regression using **R**
### <p style="color:#00449E"> Visualizations to diagnose the quality of modeling results

.panelset[
.panel[.panel-name[Quality?]
- The following two visualizations from the linear regression are useful to determine the quality of linear regression:

  1. Actual vs. predicted outcome plot;
  2. Residual plot.

]




.panel[.panel-name[Actual vs. Predicted]
 

- The following is **the actual vs predicted outcome plot**.


```{r, echo = T, eval= F}
ggplot( data = dtest, 
        aes(x = pred, y = PINCP) ) +
  geom_point( alpha = 0.2, color = "darkgray" ) +
  geom_smooth( color = "darkblue" ) +  
  geom_abline( color = "red", linetype = 2 )  # y = x, perfect prediction line
```
]



.panel[.panel-name[Residuals]


- The following is **the residual plot**.

  - `Residual[i] = y[i] -  Predicted_y[i]`.



```{r, echo = T, eval= F}
ggplot(data = dtest, 
       aes(x = pred, y = PINCP - pred)) +
  geom_point(alpha = 0.2, color = "darkgray") +
  geom_smooth( color = "darkblue" ) +   
  geom_hline( aes( yintercept = 0 ),  # perfect prediction 
              color = "red", linetype = 2) + 
  labs(x = 'Predicted PINCP', y = "Residual error")
```

]




.panel[.panel-name[Q & A]


- From the plot of actual vs. predicted outcomes and the plot of residuals, we should ask the following the two questions ourselves:

  - On average, are the predictions correct?
  - Are there systematic errors?

- A well-behaved plot will bounce *randomly* and form a cloud roughly around the perfect prediction line.

# Linear Regression using **R**
### <p style="color:#00449E"> Practical considerations in linear regression

.panelset[
.panel[.panel-name[Correlation vs. Causation]

- Correlation does not imply causation:

  - Just because a coefficient is significant, doesn’t mean our explanatory variable causes the response of our outcome variable.
  
  - In order to test cause-and-effect relationships through regression, we would often need data from (quasi-)experiments to remove *selection bias*.


]

.panel[.panel-name[RCT & A/B testing]

- To achieve causality, researchers conduct experiments such as randomized controlled trials (RCT) and A/B testing:
  - The treatment group receives the treatment whose effect the researcher is interested in.
  - The control group receives either no treatment or a placebo. 
  - The treatment variable indicates the status of treatment and control.
 
 
- In linear regression, if all explanatory variables apart from the treatment variable are made equal across the two groups, selection bias is mostly eliminated, so that we may infer *causality* from beta estimates. 
  
]


.panel[.panel-name[Practical significance]
- There is a difference between practical significance and statistical significance:

  - Whether an association between `x` and `y` is *practically significant* depends heavily on *the unit of measurement*.
  
  - E.g., We regressed income (measured in $) on height, and got a statistically significant beta estimate of 100, with a standard error of 20. 
  
  - **Q**. Is 100 a large effect?

# Linear Regression using **R**
### <p style="color:#00449E"> More Explanatory Variables in the Model


- In the 2016 US Census PUMS dataset, personal data recorded includes occupation, level of education, personal income, and many other demographic variables:

  - `COW`: class of worker
  - `SCHL`: level of education

# Linear Regression using **R**
### <p style="color:#00449E"> More Explanatory Variables in the Model

- Suppose we also want to assess how personal income varies with (1) a bachelor's degree, (2) a class of work on personal income, (3) age, and (4) gender.

  1. Conduct the exploratory data analysis.
  2. Based on the visualization, set a hypothesis regarding the relationship between having bachelor's degree and `PINCP`.
  3. Train the linear regression model.
  4. Interpret the beta coefficients from the linear regression result.
  5. Calculate the predicted `PINCP` using the testing data.
  6. Draw the actual vs. predicted outcome plot and the residual plot.
