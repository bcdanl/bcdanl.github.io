# Linear Regression 
### <p style="color:#00449E">  Example

- Suppose we also want to estimate how gender will affect personal income. 
- Linear regression assumes that ...
  - The outcome `PINCP[i]` is linearly related to each of the inputs `AGEP[i]` and `SEX[i]`:

$$\texttt{PINCP[i]} \;=\quad \texttt{f(AGEP[i], SEX[i])} \,+\, \texttt{e[i]} \qquad\qquad\qquad\qquad\\
\;=\quad \texttt{b0} \,+\, \texttt{b1*AGEP[i]} \,+\, \texttt{b2*SEX[i]}\,+\, \texttt{e[i]}$$
- A variable on the left-hand side is called an outcome variable or a dependent variable.
- Variables on the right-hand side are called explanatory variables, independent variables, or input variables.
- Coefficients $\texttt{b[1]}, ... , \texttt{b[P]}\;$  on the right-hand side are called beta coefficients.




---
# Linear Regression 
### <p style="color:#00449E">  Goals of Linear Regression

-  The goals of linear regression are  ... 
  1. Find the estimated values of `b1` and `b2`: $\quad \hat{\texttt{b1}}$ and $\hat{\texttt{b2}}$.
  
  2. Make a prediction on `PINCP[i]` for each person `i`: $\quad \widehat{\texttt{PINCP}}\texttt{[i]}$.

$$\widehat{\texttt{PINCP}}\texttt{[i]} \;=\quad \hat{\texttt{b0}} \,+\, \hat{\texttt{b1}}\texttt{*AGEP[i]} \,+\, \hat{\texttt{b2}}\texttt{*SEX[i]}$$

- We will use the hat notation $(\,\hat{\texttt{ }}\,)$  to distinguish *estimated* beta coefficients and *predicted* outcomes from *true* values of beta coefficients and *true* values of outcome variables, respectively.

---
# Linear Regression 
### <p style="color:#00449E">  More Assumptions

- Assumptions on the linear regression model are that ...

  - The outcome variable is a linear combination of the explanatory variables.
  
  - Errors have a mean value of 0.
  
  - Errors are *uncorrelated* with explanatory variables.


---
# Linear Regression 
### <p style="color:#00449E"> Beta estimates

- Linear regression finds the beta coefficients $( \texttt{b[0]}, ... , \texttt{b[P]} )$ such that ...

  – The linear function $\texttt{f(x[i, ])}$ is as near as possible to
$\texttt{y[i]}$ for all $\texttt{(x[i, ], y[i])}$ pairs in the data.


- In other words, the estimator for the beta coefficients is chosen to minimize the sum of squares of the *residual errors* (SSR):

  -  $\texttt{Residual_Error[i] = y[i] - } \hat{\texttt{y}}\,\texttt{[i]}$.
  
  -  $\texttt{SSR} = \texttt{Residual_Error[1]}^{2} + \cdots + \texttt{Residual_Error[N]}^{2}$.




---
# Linear Regression 
### <p style="color:#00449E"> Example of Prediction

.pull-left[
- Linear regression often does an excellent job, even when the actual relation between $\texttt{x[i, ]}$ and $\texttt{y[i]}$ is not linear.

  - For example, $y = x^2\;$ vs. $\;f(x) = -22 + 11x$

# Linear Regression 
### <p style="color:#00449E"> Evaluating Models


- **Training data**: When we're building a model to make predictions or to identify the relationships, we need *data* to build the model.

- **Testing data**: We also need data to test whether the model works well on *new data*.

.pull-left[

- So, we split data into training and test sets when building a linear regression model.

### <p style="color:#00449E"> A Little Bit of Statistics for the Uniform Distribution

.pull-left[

- The probability density function for the uniform distribution looks like:


- With the uniform distribution, any values of $x$ between 0 and 1 is equally likely drawn.

- `runif(n)` generates `n` uniform random numbers between 0 and 1.

# Linear Regression 
### <p style="color:#00449E"> Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

- Use summary statistics and visualization to explore the data, particularly for the following variables:

  - `PINCP`: personal income
  - `AGEP`: age 
  - `SEX`: sex


- It's often a better idea to get some sense of how the data behaves through EDA before doing any statistical analysis.

```{r, echo = T, eval = F}
# install.packages("GGally")  # to use GGally::ggpairs()
ggpairs( select(dtrain, PINCP, AGEP, SEX) )  # for correlogram or correlation matrix
```

```{r, echo = T, eval= F}
model <- lm(formula = PINCP ~ AGEP + SEX, 
            data = dtrain)
```
In the above line of R commands, ...
- `model`: R object to save the estimation result of linear regression
-  `lm()`: Linear regression modeling function
- `PINCP ~ AGEP + SEX`:  Formula for linear regression
- `PINCP`: Outcome/Dependent variable
- `AGEP, SEX`: Input/Independent/Explanatory variables
- `dtrain`: Data frame to use for training

# Linear Regression using **R**
### <p style="color:#00449E"> Making predictions with a linear regression model using `predict()`

```{r, echo = T, eval= F}
dtest$pred <-  predict(model, 
                       newdata = dtest)
```

- In the above line of R commands, ...
  - `dtest$pred`: Adding a new column `pred` to the `dtest` data frame. `mutate()` also works.
  - `predict()`: Function to get the predicted outcome using `model` and `dtest`
  - `model`: R object to save the estimation result of linear regression
  - `dtest`: Data frame to use in prediction


- We can make prediction using `dtrain` data frame too.

# Linear Regression using **R**
### <p style="color:#00449E"> Indicator variables

- Linear regression handles a factor variable with `m` possible levels by converting it to `m-1` indicator variables, and the rest `1` category, the first level of the factor variable, becomes a reference level.


- The value of any indicator variable is either 0 or 1.

- E.g., the indicator variable, `SEXFemale`, is follows: 

$$
\texttt{SEXFemale[i] }\\
= \begin{cases}
\texttt{1} & \text{if a person } \texttt{i} \text{ is } \texttt{female};\\\\
\texttt{0} & \text{otherwise}.\qquad\qquad\quad\,
\end{cases}
$$

- The level `male` becomes a reference level when interpreting the beta estimate for `SEXFemale`.


---
# Linear Regression using **R**
### <p style="color:#00449E"> Setting a reference level

- If the independent variable includes factor variables, we can set a reference level for each factor variable using `relevel(VARIABLE, ref = "LEVEL")`.

.panelset[

.panel[.panel-name[code]
```{r, echo = T, eval= F}
dtrain$SEX, <- relevel(dtrain$SEX, ref = "Male") 

model <- lm(log(PINCP) ~ AGEP + SEX, 
            data = dtrain)
            
summary(model)
```
]

.panel[.panel-name[variable]

- E.g., the indicator variable, `SEXMale`, is follows: 

$$
\texttt{SEXMale[i] }\\
= \begin{cases}
\texttt{1} & \text{if a person } \texttt{i} \text{ is } \texttt{male};\\\\ 
\texttt{0} & \text{otherwise}.\qquad\qquad\quad
\end{cases}
$$

- The level `female` now becomes a reference level.

- Note: Changing the reference level does not change the regression result.

# Linear Regression using **R**
### <p style="color:#00449E"> Interpreting Estimated Coefficients

- What does it mean for a beta estimate $\hat{\texttt{b}}$ to be statistically significant at 5% level?

  - It means that the null hypothesis $H_{0}: \texttt{b} = 0$ is rejected for a given significance level 5%.
  
  - "2 standard error rule" of thumb: The true value of $\texttt{b}$ is 95% likely to be in the confidence interval $(\, \hat{\texttt{b}} - 2 * \texttt{Std. Error}\;,\; \hat{\texttt{b}} + 2 * \texttt{Std. Error} \,)$.
  
  - The standard error tells us how uncertain our estimate of the coefficient `b` is.
 
  - We should look for the stars!

---
# Linear Regression using **R**
### <p style="color:#00449E"> **R-squared**

- **R-squared** is a measure of how well the model “fits” the data, or its “goodness of fit.”
  - **R-squared** can be thought of as *what fraction of the `y`'s variation is explained by the independent variables*.
  
  
- **R-squared** will be higher for models with more explanatory variables, regardless of whether the additional explanatory variables actually improve the model or not.
- We want **R-squared** to be *fairly* large and **R-squareds** that are similar on testing and training.


- The adjusted **R-squared** is the multiple **R-squared** penalized for the number of input variables.




---
# Linear Regression using **R**
### <p style="color:#00449E"> Visualizations to diagnose the quality of modeling results

.panelset[
.panel[.panel-name[Quality?]
- The following two visualizations from the linear regression are useful to determine the quality of linear regression:

  1. Actual vs. predicted outcome plot;
  2. Residual plot.

]




.panel[.panel-name[Actual vs. Predicted]
 

- The following is **the actual vs predicted outcome plot**.


```{r, echo = T, eval= F}
ggplot( data = dtest, 
        aes(x = pred, y = PINCP) ) +
  geom_point( alpha = 0.2, color = "darkgray" ) +
  geom_smooth( color = "darkblue" ) +  
  geom_abline( color = "red", linetype = 2 )  # y = x, perfect prediction line
```
]



.panel[.panel-name[Residuals]


- The following is **the residual plot**.

  - `Residual[i] = y[i] -  Predicted_y[i]`.



```{r, echo = T, eval= F}
ggplot(data = dtest, 
       aes(x = pred, y = PINCP - pred)) +
  geom_point(alpha = 0.2, color = "darkgray") +
  geom_smooth( color = "darkblue" ) +   
  geom_hline( aes( yintercept = 0 ),  # perfect prediction 
              color = "red", linetype = 2) + 
  labs(x = 'Predicted PINCP', y = "Residual error")
```

]




.panel[.panel-name[Q & A]


- From the plot of actual vs. predicted outcomes and the plot of residuals, we should ask the following two questions ourselves:

  - On average, are the predictions correct?
  - Are there systematic errors?

- A well-behaved plot will bounce *randomly* and form a cloud roughly around the perfect prediction line.

# Linear Regression using **R**
### <p style="color:#00449E"> Practical considerations in linear regression

.panelset[
.panel[.panel-name[Correlation vs. Causation]

- Correlation does not imply causation:

  - Just because a coefficient is significant, doesn’t mean our explanatory variable causes the response of our outcome variable.
  
  - In order to test cause-and-effect relationships through regression, we would often need data from (quasi-)experiments to remove *selection bias*.


]

.panel[.panel-name[RCT & A/B testing]

- To achieve causality, researchers conduct experiments such as randomized controlled trials (RCT) and A/B testing:
  - The treatment group receives the treatment whose effect the researcher is interested in.
  - The control group receives either no treatment or a placebo. 
  - The treatment variable indicates the status of treatment and control.
 
 
- In linear regression, if all explanatory variables apart from the treatment variable are made equal across the two groups, selection bias is mostly eliminated, so that we may infer *causality* from beta estimates. 
  
]


.panel[.panel-name[Practical significance]
- There is a difference between practical significance and statistical significance:

  - Whether an association between `x` and `y` is *practically significant* depends heavily on *the unit of measurement*.
  
  - E.g., We regressed income (measured in $) on height, and got a statistically significant beta estimate of 100, with a standard error of 20. 
  
  - **Q**. Is 100 a large effect?

# Linear Regression using **R**
### <p style="color:#00449E"> More Explanatory Variables in the Model


- In the 2016 US Census PUMS dataset, personal data recorded includes occupation, level of education, personal income, and many other demographic variables:

  - `COW`: class of worker
  - `SCHL`: level of education



---
# Linear Regression using **R**
### <p style="color:#00449E"> More Explanatory Variables in the Model

- Suppose we also want to assess how personal income varies with (1) a bachelor's degree, (2) a class of work on personal income, (3) age, and (4) gender.

  1. Conduct the exploratory data analysis.
  2. Based on the visualization, set a hypothesis regarding the relationship between having bachelor's degree and `PINCP`.
  3. Train the linear regression model.
  4. Interpret the beta coefficients from the linear regression result.
  5. Calculate the predicted `PINCP` using the testing data.
  6. Draw the actual vs. predicted outcome plot and the residual plot.
