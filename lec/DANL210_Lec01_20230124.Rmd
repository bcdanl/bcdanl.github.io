# Installing the Tools
### <p style="color:#00449E"> Anaconda </p>

- Anaconda is an all-in-one Python distribution.
  - Anaconda includes Python 3.x and its standard modules such as pip, pandas, matplotlib, etc.
  - Anaconda also includes several software applications of integrated development environment (IDE), which is a software for editing codes.
  - For the Python code, we will use **Spyder** IDE.  
    - Do not use RStudio from Anaconda, because RStudio from Anaconda is out-dated.

  
- To install Anaconda, go to the following download page:
  - [https://www.anaconda.com/products/distribution](https://www.anaconda.com/products/distribution).
  - Click the "Download" button.


---
# Installing the Tools
### <p style="color:#00449E"> Spyder IDE </p>

- If Spyder IDE from Anaconda is lagging, consider installing it additionally.
  
- To install Spyder IDE in addition to Anaconda, go to the following download page:
  - [https://www.spyder-ide.org](https://www.spyder-ide.org).
  - Click the "DOWNLOAD" menu.

# Coding Workflow
### <p style="color:#00449E"> Code and comment style </p>
- The two main principles for coding and managing data are:
  - Make things easier for your future self.
  - Don't trust your future self.

- The `#` mark is Spyder's comment character.
  - `#` indicates that the rest of the line is to be ignored.
  - Write comments before the line that you want the comment to apply to.

- Consider using block commenting for separating code sections.
  - `# %%` defines a coding block in Spyder.

- Break down long lines and long algebraic expressions.

# Getting started with `pandas`

---
#  `pandas`

```{r, echo=FALSE, out.width = '48%', fig.align='center'}
knitr::include_graphics("../lec_figs/pandas-logo.png")
```

- `pandas` is a Python library including the following features:
  - Data manipulation and analysis;
  - Export and import data from files and web;
  - Handling of missing data.

- `pandas` provides high-performance data structures and data analysis tools.

```{python, echo = T, eval = F}
import pandas as pd
```



---
#  `pandas`

- To give Python these enhanced features, Pandas introduces two new data types to Python: `Series` and `DataFrame`. 

  - The `DataFrame` will represent your entire spreadsheet or rectangular data.
  - The `Series` is like a single column of the `DataFrame`. 


---
#  `pandas`
### <p style="color:#00449E"> Learning Objectives </p>
- Use Pandas functions to load a simple delimited data file

- Calculate how many rows and columns were loaded

- Identify the type of data that were loaded

- Name differences between functions, methods, and attributes

- Use methods and attributes to subset rows and columns

- Calculate basic grouped and aggregated statistics from data

- Use methods and attributes to create a simple figure from data
