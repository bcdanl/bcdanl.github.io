# Coding Workflow
### <p style="color:#00449E"> Code and comment style </p>
- The two main principles for coding and managing data are:
  - Make things easier for your future self.
  - Don't trust your future self.

- The `#` mark is Spyder's comment character.
  - `#` indicates that the rest of the line is to be ignored.
  - Write comments before the line that you want the comment to apply to.

- Consider using block commenting for separating code sections.
  - `# %%` defines a coding block in Spyder.

- Break down long lines and long algebraic expressions.

#  Python Basics
### <p style="color:#00449E"> Running on Empty </p>

- Being able to create empty containers is sometimes useful, especially when using loops. 

- The commands to create empty lists, tuples, dictionaries, and sets are `lst = []`, `tup=()`, `dic={}`, and `st = set()` respectively.

**Q.** What is the type of an empty `list`?



---
#  Python Basics
### <p style="color:#00449E"> Functions </p>

- So far, all of our Python code examples have been little fragments. 
  - These are good for small tasks, but no one wants to retype fragments all the time. 
  - We need some way of organizing larger code into manageable pieces.
  
  
- The first step to code reuse is the *function*: a named piece of code, separate from all others. 


- A function can take any number and type of input *parameters* and **return** any number and type of output *results*.


- We can do two things with a function:
  - **Define** it, with zero or more parameters
  - **Call** it, and get zero or more results


---
#  Python Basics
### <p style="color:#00449E"> Functions </p>

.panelset[
.panel[.panel-name[define]
- To define a Python function, we type (1) `def`, (2) the function name, (3) parentheses enclosing any input *parameters* to the function, and then finally, (4) a colon (:). 

]

.panel[.panel-name[do nothing]
- Let's define a very simple function that has no parameters.
```{python, echo = T, eval = F}
def do_nothing():
  """This is an empty function with a docstring.
  These docstrings are used to help document the function.
  They can be created by using 3 single quotes or 3 double quotes.
  The PEP-8 style guide says to use double quotes.
  """
    pass      # indention is needed here
```

- We use the `pass` statement when we want Python to do nothing.
  - It's the equivalent of *This page intentionally left blank.*

]

.panel[.panel-name[call]
- We call the `do_nothing()` function just by typing its name and parentheses. 
```{python, echo = T, eval = F}
do_nothing()
```
]


]




---
#  Python Basics
### <p style="color:#00449E"> Functions </p>

.panelset[
.panel[.panel-name[no parameter]
- Let's define and call another function that has no parameters but prints a single word:

```{python, echo = T, eval = F}
def print_value():
  """Just prints the value 3
  """
  print(3)
  
print_value()
```

- When we called this function, Python ran the code inside its definition.
  - In this case, it printed a single word and returned to the main program.

]  

.panel[.panel-name[w/ a parameter]
- Let's try a function that takes a parameter:
```{python, echo = T, eval = F}
def print_value2(value):
  """Prints the value passed into the parameter 'value'
  """
  print(value)

print_value2(3)
print_value2('Hi!')
```
]


.panel[.panel-name[w/ parameters]
- Functions can take multiple values as well:
```{python, echo = T, eval = F}
def person(fname, lname):
  """A function that takes 2 values, and prints them
  """
  print(fname)
  print(lname)
```

]



.panel[.panel-name[w/ retrun]
-  What makes functions powerful is their ability to take inputs and `return` an output:
```{python, echo = T, eval = F}
def my_mean_2(x, y):
  """A function that returns the mean of 2 values
  """
  mean_value = (x + y) / 2
  return mean_value

m = my_mean_2(0, 10)
```

]

#  Python Basics
### <p style="color:#00449E"> Importing Modules, Packages, and Libraries </p>

- Python is a general-purpose programming language and is not specialized for numerical or statistical computation.


- The core libraries that enable Python to store and analyze data efficiently are in Python libraries.
  - `numpy` provides the basic array block used throughout numerical Python.
  - `pandas` provides DataFrames which are used to store data in an easy-to-use format.
  - `matplotlib` provides graphics. The most important submodule would be `matplotlib.pyplot`.
  - `seaborn` provides a general improvement in the default appearance of `matplotlib`-produced plots.


---
# Importing Modules, Packages, and Libraries

- A **module** is basically a bunch of related codes saved in a file with the extension `.py`.

- A **package** is basically a directory of a collection of modules. 

- A **library** is a collection of packages


- We refer to code of other modules/pacakges/libraries by using the Python `import` statement. 
  - This makes the code and variables in the imported module available to our programming codes.
  - We can use the `as` *keyword* when importing the modules using their canonical names.

# Getting started with `Pandas`

---
#  `Pandas`

```{r, echo=FALSE, eval = T, out.width = '48%', fig.align='center'}
knitr::include_graphics("../lec_figs/pandas-logo.png")
```

- `pandas` is a Python library including the following features:
  - Data manipulation and analysis;
  - Export and import data from files and web;
  - Handling of missing data.

- `pandas` provides high-performance data structures and data analysis tools.

```{python, echo = T, eval = F}
import pandas as pd
```



---
#  `Pandas`

- To give Python these enhanced features, Pandas introduces two new data types to Python: `Series` and `DataFrame`. 

  - The `DataFrame` will represent your entire spreadsheet or rectangular data.
  - The `Series` is like a single column of the `DataFrame`. 


---
#  `Pandas`
### <p style="color:#00449E"> Learning Objectives </p>
- Use Pandas functions to load a simple delimited data file

- Calculate how many rows and columns were loaded

- Identify the type of data that were loaded

- Name differences between functions, methods, and attributes

- Use methods and attributes to subset rows and columns

- Calculate basic grouped and aggregated statistics from data

- Use methods and attributes to create a simple figure from data




---
#  `Pandas`
### <p style="color:#00449E">  Load Data Sets </p>


- When given a data set, we first load it and begin looking at its structure and contents. 

- The simplest way of looking at a data set is to look at and subset specific rows and columns. 

- We can see what type of information is stored in each column, and can start looking for patterns by aggregating descriptive statistics.



---
#  `Pandas`
### <p style="color:#00449E">  Load Data Sets </p>

- With the library loaded we can use the `read_csv()` function to load a CSV data file.

- In order to access the `read_csv()` function from pandas, we use something called "dot" notation.

  - We write `pd.read_csv()` to say: within the pandas library we just loaded, look inside for the `read_csv()` function.

```{python, echo = T, eval = F}
# *.tsv is a file of tab-separated values.
# we can use the sep parameter and indicate a tab with \t
df  = pd.read_csv('https://bcdanl.github.io/data/gapminder.tsv', sep='\t')
df
```



---
#  `Pandas` - Load Data Sets

.panelset[

.panel[.panel-name[type()]

- We can check to see if we are working with a Pandas `Dataframe` by using the built-in `type()` function (i.e., it comes directly from Python, not a separate library such as Pandas).

```{python, echo = T, eval = F}
type(df)
```

- The `type()` function is handy when we begin working with many different types of Python objects and need to know what object we are currently working on.

]

.panel[.panel-name[.shape]

- Every DataFrame object has a `.shape` attribute that will give us the number of rows and columns of the `DataFrame`.


```{python, echo = T, eval = F}
df.shape
#  It’s written as df.shape and not df.shape()
```

-  Since `.shape` is an **attribute** of the `DataFrame` object, and not a **function** or **method** of the `DataFrame` object, it does not have round parentheses after the period.

]

.panel[.panel-name[.columns]

- To get a gist of what information the data set contains, we look at the column names. 

- The column names are given using the `.column` attribute of the `DataFrame` object.


```{python, echo = T, eval = F}
df.columns
```

- Q. What is the `type` of the column names?

]


.panel[.panel-name[.dtypes]

-  Each column (i.e., `Series`) has to be the same type, whereas each row can contain mixed types.

- We can use the `.dtypes` attribute or the `.info()` method to see the type of each column in `DataFrame`.

```{python, echo = T, eval = F}
df.dtypes
df.info()
```


]

]




---
# Look at Columns, Rows, and Cells
### <p style="color:#00449E">  Select and Subset Columns by Name </p>


.panelset[

.panel[.panel-name[head()]

- We can use the `.head()` method of a `DataFrame` to look at the first 5 rows of our data.
  - This is useful to see if our data loaded properly, and to get a better sense of the columns and contents.

```{python, echo = T, eval = F}
df.head()
```

]


.panel[.panel-name[`[ ]`]

- If we want only a specific column from our data, we can access the data using square brackets, `[ ]`.

```{python, echo = T, eval = F}
# just get the country column and save it to its own variable
country_df = df['country']
# show the first 5 observations
country_df.head()
```

]


.panel[.panel-name[`[ [] ]`]

- In order to specify multiple columns by the column name, we need to pass in a Python list between the square brackets.


```{python, echo = T, eval = F}
# Looking at country, continent, and year
subset = df[['country', 'continent', 'year']]
subset
```

]

]



---
# Look at Columns, Rows, and Cells
### <p style="color:#00449E">   Single Value Returns `DataFrame` or `Series` </p>

.panelset[

.panel[.panel-name[Series]

- When we first select a single column, a `Series` object comes out.

```{python}
country_df = df['country']
type(country_df)
country_df
```

]

.panel[.panel-name[ DataFrame]
- Compare `df['country']` with `df[ ['country'] ]`
```{python}
country_df_list = df[ ['country'] ]
type(country_df_list)
country_df_list
```

-  If we use a list to subset, we will always get a `DataFrame` object back.
]


]


---
# Look at Columns, Rows, and Cells
### <p style="color:#00449E"> Using Dot Notation to Pull a Column of Values </p>

- There is a shorthand notation where we can pull the column by treating it as a `DataFrame` attribute, or using dot (`.`).

```{python}
df['country']
df.country
```

- We do have to be mindful of what our columns are named if we want to use the dot notation. 

  - If there is a column named `shape`, the `df.shape` will return the number of rows and columns
  
  - If our column name has spaces or special characters, we will not be able to use the dot notation to select that column of values.



---
# Look at Columns, Rows, and Cells
### <p style="color:#00449E">  Subset Rows </p>

- Rows can be subset in multiple ways, by row name or row index.


```{r, out.width='100%', fig.align='center'}
text_tbl <- data.frame(
  `Subset Attribute` = c(".loc[]", ".iloc[]"),
  Description = c("Subset based on index lable (row name)",
"Subset based on row index (row number)")
  )


kable(text_tbl, format = "html") %>%
  kable_paper(full_width = T) %>%
  column_spec(1, bold = T, border_right = T) %>%
  kable_styling(html_font = 'sans-serif, helvetica, arial',
                bootstrap_options = c("hover", "condensed") )

```




---
# Look at Columns, Rows, and Cells
### <p style="color:#00449E">   Subset Rows by `index` Label: `.loc[]` </p>


.panelset[

.panel[.panel-name[Index]

- Let's take a look at our gapminder data:
```{python}
df
```

- We can see on the left side of the printed `DataFrame`, what appear to be row numbers.
  -  This column-less row of values is the "index" label of the `DataFrame`.


-  By default, Pandas fills in the index labels with the row numbers starting from 0.

]

.panel[.panel-name[`.loc[]`]
- We can use the `.loc[]` attribute on the `DataFrame` to subset rows based on the index label.

.pull-left[
```{python}
# get the first row
df.loc[0]

# get the 100th row
df.loc[99]
```
]
.pull-right[
```{python}
# get the last row
df.loc[ -1]
```
- Does `df.loc[ -1]` work?
]

]


.panel[.panel-name[last row]
- Here, passing -1 to the `.loc[]` causes an error.
  - It is actually looking for the row index label (i.e., row number -1), which does not exist in our example DataFrame.

```{python}
# use the first value given from shape to get the number of rows
number_of_rows = df.shape[0]
# subtract 1 from the value since we want the last index value
last_row_index = number_of_rows - 1

# finally do the subset using the index of the last row
df.loc[last_row_index]
```

]

.panel[.panel-name[.tail()]
- We can use the `.tail()` method to return the last `n = 1` row, instead of the default 5.
```{python}
df.tail(n = 1)
```

- Using `.tail()` and `.loc[]` prints out the results differently.
```{python}
type( df.tail(n = 1) )
type( df.loc[last_row_index] )
```

]


.panel[.panel-name[multiple rows]
- We can filter multiple rows.
```{python}
df.loc[ [0, 99, 999] ]
```


]


]


---
# Look at Columns, Rows, and Cells
### <p style="color:#00449E">  Subset Rows by Row Number: `.iloc[]` </p>

- `.iloc[]` does the same thing as `.loc[]`, but is used to subset by the row index number. 

- In our current example, gapminder DataFrame, `.iloc[]` and `.loc[]` behave exactly the same way because the index labels are the same as the row numbers.

.pull-left[
```{python}
# get the 2nd row
df.iloc[1]

# get the 100th row
df.iloc[99]
```
]
.pull-right[
```{python}
# get the last row
df.iloc[ -1]. # does it work?

# get the first, 100th, and 1000th row
df.iloc[ [0, 99, 999] ]
```
]




---
# Look at Columns, Rows, and Cells
### <p style="color:#00449E">  Mix It Up </p>

- We can use `.loc[]` and `.iloc[]` to obtain rows, columns, or both.
-  The general syntax for `.loc[]` and `.iloc[]` uses square brackets with a comma.
  - `df.loc[ [rows], [columns] ]`
  - `df.iloc[ [rows], [columns] ]`
  
  
- To just subset columns, we can use the slicing methods.
  -  If we are subsetting columns, we are getting all the rows for the specified column.
  -  So, we need a method to capture all the rows.
  -  If we have just a colon (`:`) when using slicing methods, it "slices" all the values in that axis.


---
# Look at Columns, Rows, and Cells
### <p style="color:#00449E">  Selecting Columns </p>

-  We can write `df.loc[:, [columns]]` or `df.iloc[:, [columns]]` to subset the column(s).

```{python}
# subset columns with loc
subset_1 = df.loc[:, ['year', 'pop']]
subset_1

# subset columns with iloc
# iloc will allow us to use integers -1 to select the last column
subset_2 = df.iloc[:, [2, 4, -1]]
subset_2

# do the followings work?
subset = df.loc[:, [2, 4, -1]] 
subset = df.iloc[:, ['year', 'pop']]
```


---
# Look at Columns, Rows, and Cells
### <p style="color:#00449E">   Subsetting with `range()` </p>

- We can use the built-in `range()` function to create a range of integer values. 
  - By default, `range(start, stop)` creates all integer values between the beginning and the end (inclusive left, exclusive right).
  - FYI, we can also pass in a 3rd parameter into `range(start, stop, step)`, `step`, that allows us to change how to increment between the start and stop values (defaults to `step=1`).


```{python}
# create a range of integers from 0 to 4 inclusive
small_range = list( range(5) )   # equivalent to range(0, 5)
small_range
# subset the dataframe with the range
subset = df.iloc[:, small_range]
subset
```




---
# Look at Columns, Rows, and Cells
### <p style="color:#00449E">   Subsetting with `range()` </p>

- Let's consider one more example with `range()`:

```{python}
#  create a range from 3 to 5 inclusive
small_range = list( range(3, 6) )

subset = df.iloc[:, small_range]
subset
```


- **Q**. What happens when you specify a `range()` that’s beyond the number of columns you have?



---
# Look at Columns, Rows, and Cells
### <p style="color:#00449E">   Subsetting with Slicing `:` </p>

- Unlike the `range()` function, the slicing method separates the values with the colon within the square bracket, `[start : end : step ]`.

- Let's see the columns of the DataFrame:
```{python}
df.columns
```

- See how `range()` and `:` are used to slice the first 3 columns.
```{python}
small_range = list( range(3) )
subset_1 = df.iloc[ : , small_range ]

subset_2 = df.iloc[ : , :3 ]
```



---
# Look at Columns, Rows, and Cells
### <p style="color:#00449E">   Subsetting with Slicing `:` </p>

**Q**. Let's slice the columns 3 to 5 inclusive using (1) the `range()` function and (2) the slicing method.


**Q**. What happens if we use the slicing method with 2 colons, but leave a value out? For example:
```{python}
 df.iloc[: , 0 : 6 :   ]
 df.iloc[: , 0 :   : 2 ]
 df.iloc[: ,   : 6 : 2 ]
 df.iloc[: ,   :   : 2 ]
 df.iloc[: ,   :   :   ]
```
