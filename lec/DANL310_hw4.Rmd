Publish your web-page in your personal website on GitHub, just like this web-page, by 1:00 P.M., April 28. But, if you need an extension, let me know!

- For each section, provide both R codes to produce interactive/animated plots and the output of your R codes.

- The title of each Section is the name of R package you need for this homework.

# `gganimate`

The following link is for the data that is used to generate the figure in this Section.
```{r, message=F}
imf_growth <- read_csv(url('https://bcdanl.github.io/data/imf_growth_quarterly.csv'))

# gy: growth rate of GDP per worker 
```

  - `geom_tile()` and `geom_text()` can be useful for this.

The effect of the COVID-19 Pandemic on economic growth can be observed in the animation above. 


# `ggiraph`
The following link is for the data that is used to generate the figure in this Section.

```{r, message = F}
climate_opinion <- read_csv(
  'https://bcdanl.github.io/data/climate_opinion_2021.csv')
# Variable `human` is a percentage of people who believe that global warming is mostly caused by human activity.
```


````{=html}
```{r, echo=FALSE, results='asis'}
xfun::file_string('/Users/byeong-hakchoe/Documents/website/bcdanl.github.io/climate_opinion_map_interactive.html')
```
````

You can hover your mouse cursor on the map and see the percentage level and the name of county.
