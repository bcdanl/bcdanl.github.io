# Climate Change
&lt;html&gt;&lt;div style='float:left'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;hr color='#EB811B' size=1px width=796px&gt;&lt;/html&gt;


---
# Climate Change
### &lt;p style="color:#00449E"&gt;   &lt;/p&gt;
- Accumulation of greenhouses gases (e.g. carbon dioxide, methane) and the resulting “carbon blanket” warms the earth

- Threats to human welfare and natural ecosystems



---
# A Hotter Planet
### &lt;p style="color:#00449E"&gt;  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;img src="lec_figs/nasa-temp.png" width="70%" style="display: block; margin: auto;" /&gt;
- 2019, second hottest year ever. The last decade was the hottest in the last several thousand years.



---
# Potential Consequences
### &lt;p style="color:#00449E"&gt;  &lt;/p&gt;

- Heatwaves, Droughts and Floods
  - “Extreme weather events” due to more water vapor in the atmosphere
  - Impacts on agriculture
--


- Major changes in natural ecosystems
  - Pests and Diseases
  - Accelerated species extinction
--


- Sea Level Rise---+ 3 ft by 2100
  - Potential for + 70 ft of sea level rise over the next few hundred years: depends on how hot it gets




---
# Global Warming
### &lt;p style="color:#00449E"&gt;  &lt;/p&gt;
- Scientists agree that global warming is already here (IPCC, 2015)


- Future warming depends on:
  - The scale of human emissions of greenhouse gasses 
  - Positive and negative feedback effects in the climate system (acceleration and deceleration of warming, respectively)
  
  

---
# How hot will it get?
### &lt;p style="color:#00449E"&gt;  &lt;/p&gt;

- Atmospheric CO2 levels in 1880: 280ppm.
  - Now: +410 ppm.


- Global temperature rise since 1880:
  - 2.0°F (&gt; 1.0°C)


- By 2100:
  - +3°F to +9°F over 1880 levels.


- Last Ice Age: 
  - Avg. global temp: 9°F colder than today.
		 

---
# 1. How Much is Too Much?
### &lt;p style="color:#00449E"&gt;  &lt;/p&gt;
- The efficiency standard: a benefit-cost test

- The safety standard: reduce pollution to “safe” levels, unless the costs of doing so are prohibitive

- The sustainability standard:  protect natural ecosystems from major changes, unless the costs of doing so are prohibitive

---
# How Much is Too Much?
### &lt;p style="color:#00449E"&gt; Climate Change &lt;/p&gt;
- The 2015 UN Paris Climate Agreement:

  - hold global temperature increases to no more than 4°F, with a preferred target  of 3°F.
  
  - Based on a safety (and sustainability) goal of preventing “dangerous interference” with the climate.

---
# How Much is Too Much?
### &lt;p style="color:#00449E"&gt; Climate Change &lt;/p&gt;
- Efficiency approach, based on cost-benefit analysis. 


- William Nordhaus
  - Efficient target is 5°F. 


- Nicholas Stern
  - Efficient target is 4°F.
  
  
Note: The overwhelming majority of economists agree that significant action to reduce global warming pollution is needed soon to achieve an efficient outcome.



---
# An Ethical Debate
### &lt;p style="color:#00449E"&gt;  &lt;/p&gt;

- We will see that the debate over which standard is “right” depends on how society chooses to both measure and weigh the costs and benefits of pollution reduction and resource protection.



---
# 2. Is Government Up to the Job?
### &lt;p style="color:#00449E"&gt;  &lt;/p&gt;
- Economic theory shows why government action is required to reduce pollution in a market economy


- Nevertheless, there are two obstacles to effective government intervention
  - Imperfect information
  - Opportunity for political influence
  
  


---
# Is Government Up to the Job?
### &lt;p style="color:#00449E"&gt;  &lt;/p&gt;
- Some people view governmental intervention as a necessary evil and argue for a limited government role.  
  
  - They believe government actors primarily serve special interests.
--

- Other people believe government can promote an activist agenda to serve the general interest of the public.

  - They believe government failures result from unequal distributions of wealth and power in society.




---
# The Role of Economics
### &lt;p style="color:#00449E"&gt;  &lt;/p&gt;
- Economists have political biases that tend to push them in one direction or the other.


- Still, economists try to objectively assess the costs and benefits of cleaning up the environment and protecting resources, and to make recommendations to achieve social goals as cost-effectively as possible.




---
# 3. How Can We Do Better?
### &lt;p style="color:#00449E"&gt;  &lt;/p&gt;

- Today, the predominant method of environmental protection is “command-and-control regulation”
  
  - Government mandates the adoption of certain abatement technologies
  
  - Criticized as a “one-size-fits-all” policy, more costly than necessary



---
# 3. How Can We Do Better?
### &lt;p style="color:#00449E"&gt; Incentive-Based Regulation &lt;/p&gt;

- Incentive-based regulation approaches set mandatory emission reduction targets and then allow industry (and consumers) decide how best to comply


- The government provides firms and consumersh incentives to reduce emissions (e.g. a tax on pollution, or a cap-and-trade system)



---
# Incentive-Based Regulation
### &lt;p style="color:#00449E"&gt; The climate case &lt;/p&gt;

- To achieve 4°F: 
  - A global tax on carbon of $70 a ton today rising to $224 a ton by 2050.


- To achieve 5° F: 
  - A global tax on carbon of $25 a ton today rising to $93 a ton by 2050.


--

- A price of $70 would raise
  - $.70 per gallon of gas
  - $.07 per KwH of coal fired electricity




- A price of $25 would raise
  - $.25 per gallon of gas
  - $.025 per KwH of coal fired electricity


---
# 3. How Can We Do Better?
### &lt;p style="color:#00449E"&gt; Promotion of Clean Technologies &lt;/p&gt;

- Government can also directly promote the adoption of clean technologies 
  
  - Research and development funding
  
  - Subsidies  for “infant industries”
  
  - Infrastructure investment
  
  - “Technology forcing” standards

  - Technical assistance
  
  


---
# 4. Can We Resolve Global Issues? 
### &lt;p style="color:#00449E"&gt;  &lt;/p&gt;

- Reducing global poverty 

- Slowing population growth and unsustainable consumption patterns

- Halting excessive exploitation of natural resources and cutting pollution

- Developing effective international agreements




---
# 4. Can We Resolve Global Issues? 
### &lt;p style="color:#00449E"&gt; Climate Change &lt;/p&gt;

- Paris Agreement: 
  - Countries make individual carbon reduction pledges adding up to the 6°F target. 
  - US: 30% reductions by 2030. 
  - China: Cap emissions by 2030.


- Agreements like Paris Commitment face two major obstacles:
  - They are  “public goods”  and create incentives for “free-riding”
  - Low income countries argue they cannot afford emission reductions

# Ethics and Economics
&lt;html&gt;&lt;div style='float:left'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;hr color='#EB811B' size=1px width=796px&gt;&lt;/html&gt;


---
# Introduction
### &lt;p style="color:#00449E"&gt; Normative vs. Positive &lt;/p&gt;

- Positive issues focus on what is

- Normative issues focus on what should be

- The question “How Much Pollution Is Too Much?” is a normative issue

- Normative analysis requires clearly stating underlying ethical assumptions

- While these two types of analysis are conceptually distinct, they often inform each other. 



---
# Three standards
### &lt;p style="color:#00449E"&gt;  &lt;/p&gt;

- To answer the question, “How Much Pollution is too Much?” we will examine three different pollution standards:

  1. Efficiency standard
  2. Sustainability standard
  3. Safety standard



---
# Utility and Utilitarianism
### &lt;p style="color:#00449E"&gt;  &lt;/p&gt;

- Utilitarianism argues that environmental cleanup is important solely for the happiness (utility) that it brings to people alive today and in the future

- Utilitarianism is the ethical foundation of economics




---
# Utility Function
### &lt;p style="color:#00449E"&gt; What Makes People Happy? &lt;/p&gt;

- “Goods” include any and all things people desire, including
  - Market goods (tomatoes, movies, basketball shoes)
  - Non-market goods (clean air, charitable deeds, the view from a mountaintop)


- The positive relationship between the consumption of goods and utility can be represented in a “utility function”
	



---
# Utility Function
### &lt;p style="color:#00449E"&gt;  &lt;/p&gt;

- A utility function for a person named Aldo on a given day could be

$$
`\begin{align}
Utility_{Aldo} \,=\, U_{Aldo}\left(\, &amp;tomatoes, movies, shoes, \left.&amp;clean\_air,\right.\notag\\ charitable\_deeds, mountaintop\_views \,\right) \notag
\end{align}`
$$

- We can bundle these goods into a consumption bundle ( `\(X_{A}\)` ) and express Aldo’s utility in this way:

$$
`\begin{align}
Utility_{A} \,=\, U_{A}\left(\, X_{A} \,\right)\notag
\end{align}`
$$


---
# Utility Function
### &lt;p style="color:#00449E"&gt; Adding Pollution &lt;/p&gt;
- Producing the goods Aldo consumes causes pollution to which Aldo is exposed ( `\(P_{A}\)` ) 

- Aldo’s utility function: 

$$
`\begin{align}
Utility_{A} \,=\, U_{A}\left(\, X_{A},\, P_{A} \,\right),\notag
\end{align}`
$$
- where Aldo's utility declines as `\(P_{A}\)` increases


- Illustrates a trade-off between growth in consumption and improvements in environmental quality




---
# Utility Function
### &lt;p style="color:#00449E"&gt; More is Better Assumption &lt;/p&gt;

- Economists often make the assumption that &lt;u&gt;more is better&lt;/u&gt; (i.e. Aldo is always happier with more “goods”)

  - Is this a reasonable assumption? 




---
# Social Welfare
### &lt;p style="color:#00449E"&gt;  &lt;/p&gt;

- Do increases in &lt;u&gt;individual&lt;/u&gt; consumption increase the overall welfare of a &lt;u&gt;society&lt;/u&gt;?


- To answer this question and make explicit their assumptions about &lt;u&gt;fairness&lt;/u&gt;, economists specify a “social welfare function”


---
# Social Welfare
### &lt;p style="color:#00449E"&gt;  &lt;/p&gt;

In a society including Rachel ( `\(R\)` ), John ( `\(J\)` ), and many others ( `\(\cdots\)` ), we can write
$$
`\begin{align}
SW = f\left(\,U_{R}\left(\, X_{R},\, P_{R} \,\right),\, U_{J}\left(\, X_{J},\, P_{J} \,\right),\, \cdots \,\right),\notag
\end{align}`
$$
- where increases in `\(X\)` increase social welfare and increases in `\(P\)` decrease social welfare

- For example: the &lt;u&gt;unweighted sum&lt;/u&gt; of individual utilities.

$$
`\begin{align}
SW = U_{R}\left(\, X_{R},\, P_{R} \,\right) \,+\, U_{J}\left(\, X_{J},\, P_{J} \,\right) \,+\, \cdots\,, \notag
\end{align}`
$$
- which implicitly assumes &lt;u&gt;equal marginal utilities of consumption&lt;/u&gt; 




---
# 1. The Efficiency Standard
### &lt;p style="color:#00449E"&gt;  &lt;/p&gt;
- The above is the “adding up” mechanism underlying an efficiency standard for pollution control


- Under an efficiency standard, the idea is to &lt;u&gt;maximize the net benefits&lt;/u&gt; of economic growth


- This is done without reference to who bears the costs or gains the benefits


---
# 1. The Efficiency Standard
### &lt;p style="color:#00449E"&gt; Example: Strawberries &lt;/p&gt;

- Suppose pesticide use on strawberries causes human sickness that costs members of society $100 million per year.


- Pesticide use also lowers strawberry prices to consumers by $150 million per year.


- In this case, the net benefits of pesticide use (benefits minus costs) are $50 million.


- Since the net benefits are positive, banning the pesticide would be inefficient.
  - (For simplicity, assume no other benefits or costs)




---
# Defending the Efficiency Standard
### &lt;p style="color:#00449E"&gt;  &lt;/p&gt;

- Proponents of an efficiency standard argue that, over time, most people will benefit if the net economic benefits from pollution control are maximized

- Lower prices of consumer goods for the majority must be balanced against protection of environmental quality and health



---
# Efficiency: Digging Deeper
### &lt;p style="color:#00449E"&gt;  &lt;/p&gt;

- To determine the “correct” level of pollution from a social standpoint, we need to weigh one person’s consumption against another’s

- The assumption of equal marginal utility of consumption says that additions to consumption are valued equally by all individuals

- This is implicit behind the efficiency standard 



---
# Efficiency does not equal fairness
### &lt;p style="color:#00449E"&gt;  &lt;/p&gt;


- No special protection for low income people (no concern for intrangenerational fairness)

- No special protection for the well-being of future generations (no concern for intergenerational fairness)

- No special protection for pollution victims (no differentiation between rights of polluters and victims)




---
# 2. The Sustainability Standard
### &lt;p style="color:#00449E"&gt;  &lt;/p&gt;

- Designed to protect the welfare of future generations

- Social welfare does not rise if increases in consumption today come at the expense of the welfare of our children

- To account for this, in our social welfare function, we would use a “fairness weight” to ensure fairness to future generations



---
# The Sustainability Social Welfare Function
### &lt;p style="color:#00449E"&gt;  &lt;/p&gt;

- Suppose Rachel is an “average” person not yet born and that John is an “average” person alive today

- Using a sustainability rule, we can write our social welfare function as:
$$
`\begin{align}
SW = w \times U_{R}\left(\, X_{R},\, P_{R} \,\right) \,+\, U_{J}\left(\, X_{J},\, P_{J} \,\right) \,+\, \cdots\,, \notag
\end{align}`
$$

- `\(w\)` is a weighting number big enough to insure that increases in John’s consumption do not substantially penalize Rachel. 

- With this social welfare function, increases in individual happiness today cannot come at the expense of future generations.



---
# 3. The Safety Standard
### &lt;p style="color:#00449E"&gt;  &lt;/p&gt;

- Proponents of a safety standard argue that people have a right to protection from unsolicited damage to their health

- To account for this in our social welfare function, we would use a fairness weight on pollution



---
# The Safety Standard Social Welfare Function
### &lt;p style="color:#00449E"&gt;  &lt;/p&gt;

- Suppose Rachel lives downwind from John’s steel factory and, as a result, is exposed to air pollution, `\(P_{R}\)`

- Using a safety standard, we can write our social welfare function as:

$$
`\begin{align}
SW = U_{R}\left(\, X_{R},\, w\times P_{R} \,\right) \,+\, U_{J}\left(\, X_{J},\, P_{J} \,\right) \,+\, \cdots\,, \notag
\end{align}`
$$

- Now, social welfare rises substantially less with the production of steel than it does with less-polluting commodities.

- Using a large enough `\(w\)` would essentially refuse to balance the polluting steel process (cheaper steel, and all the products the steel contains) against the harmful impact of pollution.




---
# Which Standard is Correct?
### &lt;p style="color:#00449E"&gt;  &lt;/p&gt;

- No social welfare function is “correct;” 
  - Their use helps clarify underlying assumptions in normative debates over the right level of pollution.


- By examining the ethical foundations of different views about the appropriate levels of pollution, we can develop a better understanding of why people disagree about environmental protection targets.
