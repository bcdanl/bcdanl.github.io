# Social Welfare
### &lt;p style="color:#00449E"&gt;  &lt;/p&gt;

- Do increases in &lt;u&gt;individual&lt;/u&gt; consumption increase the overall welfare of a &lt;u&gt;society&lt;/u&gt;?


- To answer this question and make explicit their assumptions about &lt;u&gt;fairness&lt;/u&gt;, economists specify a **social welfare function**


- A social welfare function represents the well-being of a society as a whole, based on the individual utilities or preferences of its members.


---
# Social Welfare
### &lt;p style="color:#00449E"&gt; Three standards &lt;/p&gt;

- To answer the question, “How Much Pollution is too Much?” we will examine three different pollution standards:

1. Efficiency standard
  - Distribution blind
2. Sustainability standard
  - Trade-off between today's and tomorrow's well-being
3. Safety standard
  - Heavy weights on victim's welfare




---
# Social Welfare
### &lt;p style="color:#00449E"&gt;  &lt;/p&gt;

In a society including Rachel ( `\(R\)` ), John ( `\(J\)` ), and many others ( `\(\cdots\)` ), we can write
$$
`\begin{align}
SW = f\left(\,U_{R}\left(\, X_{R},\, P_{R} \,\right),\, U_{J}\left(\, X_{J},\, P_{J} \,\right),\, \cdots \,\right),\notag
\end{align}`
$$
where increases in `\(X\)` increase social welfare and increases in `\(P\)` decrease social welfare

- For example: the &lt;u&gt;unweighted sum&lt;/u&gt; of individual utilities.

$$
`\begin{align}
SW = U_{R}\left(\, X_{R},\, P_{R} \,\right) \,+\, U_{J}\left(\, X_{J},\, P_{J} \,\right) \,+\, \cdots\,, \notag
\end{align}`
$$
- which implicitly assumes &lt;u&gt;equal marginal utilities of consumption&lt;/u&gt; 




---
# Efficiency does not equal fairness
### &lt;p style="color:#00449E"&gt;  &lt;/p&gt;


- No special protection for low income people (no concern for intrangenerational fairness)

- No special protection for the well-being of future generations (no concern for intergenerational fairness)

- No special protection for pollution victims (no differentiation between rights of polluters and victims)




---
# 2. The Sustainability Standard
### &lt;p style="color:#00449E"&gt;  &lt;/p&gt;

- Designed to protect the welfare of future generations

- Social welfare does not rise if increases in consumption today come at the expense of the welfare of our children

- To account for this, in our social welfare function, we would use a “fairness weight” to ensure fairness to future generations



---
# The Sustainability Social Welfare Function
### &lt;p style="color:#00449E"&gt;  &lt;/p&gt;

- Suppose Rachel is an “average” person not yet born and that John is an “average” person alive today

- Using a sustainability rule, we can write our social welfare function as:
$$
`\begin{align}
SW = w \times U_{R}\left(\, X_{R},\, P_{R} \,\right) \,+\, U_{J}\left(\, X_{J},\, P_{J} \,\right) \,+\, \cdots\,, \notag
\end{align}`
$$

- `\(w\)` is a weighting number big enough to insure that increases in John’s consumption do not substantially penalize Rachel. 

- With this social welfare function, increases in individual happiness today cannot come at the expense of future generations.



---
# 3. The Safety Standard
### &lt;p style="color:#00449E"&gt;  &lt;/p&gt;

- Proponents of a safety standard argue that people have a right to protection from unsolicited damage to their health

- To account for this in our social welfare function, we would use a fairness weight on pollution



---
# The Safety Standard Social Welfare Function
### &lt;p style="color:#00449E"&gt;  &lt;/p&gt;

- Suppose Rachel lives downwind from John’s steel factory and, as a result, is exposed to air pollution, `\(P_{R}\)`

- Using a safety standard, we can write our social welfare function as:

$$
`\begin{align}
SW = U_{R}\left(\, X_{R},\, w\times P_{R} \,\right) \,+\, U_{J}\left(\, X_{J},\, P_{J} \,\right) \,+\, \cdots\,, \notag
\end{align}`
$$

- Now, social welfare rises substantially less with the production of steel than it does with less-polluting commodities.

- Using a large enough `\(w\)` would essentially refuse to balance the polluting steel process (cheaper steel, and all the products the steel contains) against the harmful impact of pollution.




---
# Which Standard is Correct?
### &lt;p style="color:#00449E"&gt;  &lt;/p&gt;

- No social welfare function is “correct;” 
  - Their use helps clarify underlying assumptions in normative debates over the right level of pollution.


- By examining the ethical foundations of different views about the appropriate levels of pollution, we can develop a better understanding of why people disagree about environmental protection targets.

# Pollution and Resource Degradation As Externalities
&lt;html&gt;&lt;div style='float:left'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;hr color='#EB811B' size=1px width=796px&gt;&lt;/html&gt;



---
# Introduction
### &lt;p style="color:#00449E"&gt;  &lt;/p&gt;

- Any economy depends on the ecological system in which it is embedded in two fundamental ways. Humans:
  - rely on the environment as a &lt;u&gt;**source**&lt;/u&gt; of raw materials
  - exploit the environment as a &lt;u&gt;**sink**&lt;/u&gt; for waste materials


- Sources and sinks form **natural capital**, the input that nature provides for our production and consumption processes



---
# Natural Capital: Sources and Sinks
### &lt;p style="color:#00449E"&gt;  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;

&lt;img src="lec_figs/gp-fig3-1.png" width="100%" style="display: block; margin: auto;" /&gt;



---
# Pollution, Resource Degradation and Natural Capital
### &lt;p style="color:#00449E"&gt;  &lt;/p&gt;


- **Pollution** is the overuse of **sinks**

- **Resource degradation** is the overharvesting of **sources**

- These two are flip sides of the same process: the excessive exploitation of natural capital



---
# Negative Externalities
### &lt;p style="color:#00449E"&gt;  &lt;/p&gt;


- Economists define “pollution” as a **negative externality**: a cost of a transaction not borne by the buyer or seller

- Can you name examples of positive exeternalities?



---
# Three Examples of Pollution?
### &lt;p style="color:#00449E"&gt;  &lt;/p&gt;

- Tyler is eating in a smoky restaurant.
  - Is he exposed to pollution?


- Karen routinely comes in contact with low-level radioactive waste while working at a nuclear power plant. 
  - Is she exposed to pollution?


- Marilyn is trying to get some sleep while his neighbor Tipper blares the sound system.
  - Is he exposed to pollution?



---
# Three Examples of Pollution?
### &lt;p style="color:#00449E"&gt; The Answers &lt;/p&gt;

- Maybe, maybe, and yes


- If Tyler is the one smoking and he is aware of the damage it causes, then he is balancing pleasure against risk and is not being exposed to pollution


- If Karen is aware of the risk posed to her by radioactive waste and is accepting this risk in exchange for a salary then she is not being exposed to pollution


- Marilyn is clearly a victim of pollution. 
  - He is involuntarily being exposed to a by-product of Tipper’s listening experience



---
# Why Market Systems Create Pollution
### &lt;p style="color:#00449E"&gt;  &lt;/p&gt;

- From an economist’s point of view, market systems generate pollution because many natural inputs (e.g. air and water) are “underpriced”


- Because no one owns these resources, in the absence of government regulation or legal protection for pollution victims, business will use them up freely, neglecting the external costs imposed on others


---
# Internalizing the Externality
### &lt;p style="color:#00449E"&gt;  &lt;/p&gt;

- If businesses were forced to compensate victims of pollution for damages they impose, firms would, in effect, be paying for the “underpriced” natural inputs they use

- This would lead firms to conserve on its resource use and to seek cleaner production methods

- This is known as **“internalizing” the externality** and is one way of dealing with the both the problems of pollution and resource degradation



---
# Social and Private Costs in the Paper Market
### &lt;p style="color:#00449E"&gt;  &lt;/p&gt;


&lt;img src="lec_figs/gp-fig3-2.png" width="90%" style="display: block; margin: auto;" /&gt;



---
# Pollution as Market Failure
### &lt;p style="color:#00449E"&gt;  &lt;/p&gt;

- Many forms of natural capital are not (and cannot) be privately owned


- Because of this, unregulated free-market systems will generate too much pollution by any standard, due to:
  - **The open access problem**
  - **The public goods problem**



---
# The Open Access Problem
### &lt;p style="color:#00449E"&gt;  &lt;/p&gt;

- When natural capital is held in common:

- If people weigh private benefits against private (as opposed to social) costs, they will overexploit common resources when given open access

- This is called **“The Tragedy of the Commons”**


---
# The Open Access Problem
### &lt;p style="color:#00449E"&gt; Global Fisheries &lt;/p&gt;

- Close to half of America’s fisheries and more than 70% of global fisheries are overfished

- The North Atlantic is estimated to contain only one-third of the biomass of edible fish that were present in 1950

- Modern technology (bottom trawling) is damaging habitat, essentially clear-cutting, and not replanting, the ocean floor

- As stocks dwindle, the incentive for any individual fisherman is to increase his or her share of the remaining stock



---
# The Open Access Problem
### &lt;p style="color:#00449E"&gt; Vessels and Total Catch &lt;/p&gt;


&lt;img src="lec_figs/gp-fig3-3.png" width="90%" style="display: block; margin: auto;" /&gt;


---
# The Open Access Problem
### &lt;p style="color:#00449E"&gt;  &lt;/p&gt;


&lt;img src="lec_figs/gp-fig3-4.png" width="75%" style="display: block; margin: auto;" /&gt;



---
# The Open Access Problem
### &lt;p style="color:#00449E"&gt;  &lt;/p&gt;

- Private boats will go out as long as **average revenue** covers costs

- By contrast, the **profit-maximizing** catch level occurs where **marginal revenue** just exceeds **marginal cost**

- Profit earned in the industry is the sum total of the difference between marginal revenue and marginal cost for each boat that goes out

- When marginal revenue is less than marginal cost, a drop in industry-wide profits will occur


---
# Resource Rents
### &lt;p style="color:#00449E"&gt;  &lt;/p&gt;

- When natural capital is used efficiently, long-run economic profits will be earned by those who retain access to the resource

- These long-run profits, generated by restricted access to natural capital, are called **resource rents**



---
# Resource Rents in New England
### &lt;p style="color:#00449E"&gt;  &lt;/p&gt;

- Data suggest that fishing off the New England coast would have to be reduced by about 70% to eliminate overfishing and achieve an efficient harvest

- This would generate a resource rent of about $130 million

- If this were collected by the government, it would be sufficient to compensate those boats put out of business due to fishing restrictions


---
# Handling the Open Access Problem
### &lt;p style="color:#00449E"&gt;  &lt;/p&gt;

- In traditional societies, informal social pressure and tradition were relied upon to prevent overexploitation

- The modern equivalent advocated by **free-market environmentalists** would be to internalize externalities through lawsuits against an offending company or individual

- So is government regulation really needed?



---
# The Public Goods Problem
### &lt;p style="color:#00449E"&gt;  &lt;/p&gt;

- Private remedies to environmental degradation (eg law suits) run into what economists call the public goods problem

- **Public goods** are goods enjoyed in common (e.g. the warning service provided by a lighthouse)

- One key characteristic of public goods is that they are **“non-excludable”**


---
# Public Goods Problems for the Free Market
### &lt;p style="color:#00449E"&gt;  &lt;/p&gt;

- Public goods pose a problem to the free market for two reasons:
  1. **Free riding**: people benefit from public goods (like law suits)  regardless of whether or not they pay for them.
  
  2. **High transaction costs**: public goods provision require groups of people to undertake action. 
  
  - In addition, information about environmental damages is costly for groups to obtain. 
  
  - These features add extra “transactions costs” making it costly to provide the public  good. 


---
# Demand for Private and Public Goods
### &lt;p style="color:#00449E"&gt;  &lt;/p&gt;
- *With a private good*, the total demand is the *horizontal sum* of the individual demand curves

- *With a public good*, the total demand is the *vertical sum* of the individual demand curves



---
# Demand for Private and Public Goods
### &lt;p style="color:#00449E"&gt;  &lt;/p&gt;


&lt;img src="lec_figs/gp-fig3-5.png" width="100%" style="display: block; margin: auto;" /&gt;



---
# Is Sustainable Business a Solution?
### &lt;p style="color:#00449E"&gt;  &lt;/p&gt;

- **Sustainable business**: a new paradigm around economics and the environment

- Instead of viewing environmental and social problems as unwanted costs to be externalized, can business firms look at them as potential profit opportunities?



---
# Three levels of Cost-Savings
### &lt;p style="color:#00449E"&gt;  &lt;/p&gt;

- **Risk Reduction**: Firms that pro-actively reduce pollution reduce risk of regulations, legal liability, and consumer backlash

- **Resource Savings**: Firms that use water, energy, and raw materials more efficiently also reduce emissions and will often save money

- **Culture of Innovation**: Firms that see it as a part of their business to profitably solve their environmental problems create cultures that breed innovation.



---
# Challenge for the Sustainable Business Solution
### &lt;p style="color:#00449E"&gt;  &lt;/p&gt;

- Majority of firms are not focused on sustainable innovation. They can and do still raise profits by overexploiting the commons and externalizing costs.

- This leads back to the need for government policy to internalize externalities. 



---
# Summary 1
### &lt;p style="color:#00449E"&gt;  &lt;/p&gt;

- Pollution is a negative externality

- Negative externalities often arise due to open access to common property

- When access to common property resources is restricted to the efficient level, resource rents are earned

- Resource rents can be taxed to compensate those who lose from restricted access.




---
# Summary 2
### &lt;p style="color:#00449E"&gt;  &lt;/p&gt;

- Negative externalities can sometimes be internalized through lawsuits, but this runs into the …


- Public Goods Problem
  - Law suits are subject to free-riding and have high transaction costs, especially with regards to obtaining information about damages.


---
# Summary 3
### &lt;p style="color:#00449E"&gt;  &lt;/p&gt;

- Because clean-up is a public good,  government is generally expected to internalize negative externalities through: 
  
  - Regulation of access to common property.
  
  - The promotion of clean technology alternatives.


---
# Summary 4
### &lt;p style="color:#00449E"&gt;  &lt;/p&gt;

- The sustainable business movement provides hope that, through innovation, businesses can find profitable solutions to environmental and social challenges. 
  - In this way, pollution is transformed from a negative externality to a design problem.  


- But…. most firms are not focused on sustainable innovation.



---
# Summary: Bottom Line
### &lt;p style="color:#00449E"&gt;  &lt;/p&gt;

- Generally, free-market forces do not provide the right incentives to ensure that adequate care is taken to achieve an efficient level of environmental and resource protection.

- So, Government needs to step in…
