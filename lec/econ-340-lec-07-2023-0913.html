# Pollution and Resource Degradation As Externalities
&lt;html&gt;&lt;div style='float:left'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;hr color='#EB811B' size=1px width=796px&gt;&lt;/html&gt;



---
# Why Market Systems Create Pollution
### &lt;p style="color:#00449E"&gt;  &lt;/p&gt;

- From an economist’s point of view, market systems generate pollution because many natural inputs (e.g. air and water) are “underpriced”


- Because no one owns these resources, in the absence of government regulation or legal protection for pollution victims, business will use them up freely, neglecting the external costs imposed on others


---
# Internalizing the Externality
### &lt;p style="color:#00449E"&gt;  &lt;/p&gt;

- If businesses were forced to compensate victims of pollution for damages they impose, firms would, in effect, be paying for the “underpriced” natural inputs they use

- This would lead firms to conserve on its resource use and to seek cleaner production methods

- This is known as **“internalizing” the externality** and is one way of dealing with the both the problems of pollution and resource degradation




---
# Review on MC/MB curves
### &lt;p style="color:#00449E"&gt;  &lt;/p&gt;


.panelset[

.panel[.panel-name[MC and Supply]
- In a perfectly competitive market, a firm's marginal cost (MC) curve can be thought of as its supply curve:

  - Firms aim to maximize profit by producing where marginal cost (MC) equals marginal revenue (MR). 
  
  -  MC is a cost of producing one more unit of a good.
  
  - The price that a firm can charge for its product is determined by the market and is equal to its marginal revenue (P=MR).  
  
  - Therefore firms produce the quantity where MC equals the market price.
]

.panel[.panel-name[MB and Demand]
- In a perfectly competitive market, a marginal benefit (MB) curve is essentially synonymous with a demand curve.

  - The marginal benefit curve represents the maximum price a consumer is willing to pay for each additional unit of a good.
  
  - Consumers are willing to buy an additional unit of a good only if the MB of that unit is greater than or equal to its price.
  
  - The MB curve shows how many units consumers are willing to purchase at each price, which is the demand curve.

# Social and Private Costs in the Paper Market
### &lt;p style="color:#00449E"&gt;  &lt;/p&gt;


&lt;img src="lec_figs/gp-fig3-2.png" width="90%" style="display: block; margin: auto;" /&gt;



---
# Pollution as Market Failure
### &lt;p style="color:#00449E"&gt;  &lt;/p&gt;

- Many forms of natural capital are not (and cannot) be privately owned


- Because of this, unregulated free-market systems will generate too much pollution by any standard, due to:

  - **The open access problem**
  
  - **The public goods problem**



---
# The Open Access Problem
### &lt;p style="color:#00449E"&gt;  &lt;/p&gt;

- When natural capital is held in common:

- If people weigh private benefits against private (as opposed to social) costs, they will overexploit common resources when given open access

- This is called **“The Tragedy of the Commons”**


---
# The Open Access Problem
### &lt;p style="color:#00449E"&gt; Global Fisheries &lt;/p&gt;

- Close to half of America’s fisheries and more than 70% of global fisheries are overfished

- The North Atlantic is estimated to contain only one-third of the biomass of edible fish that were present in 1950

- Modern technology (bottom trawling) is damaging habitat, essentially clear-cutting, and not replanting, the ocean floor

- As stocks dwindle, the incentive for any individual fisherman is to increase his or her share of the remaining stock



---
# The Open Access Problem
### &lt;p style="color:#00449E"&gt; Vessels and Total Catch &lt;/p&gt;


&lt;img src="lec_figs/gp-fig3-3.png" width="90%" style="display: block; margin: auto;" /&gt;



---
# The Open Access Problem
### &lt;p style="color:#00449E"&gt; &lt;/p&gt;


&lt;img src="lec_figs/gp-tab3-1.png" width="80%" style="display: block; margin: auto;" /&gt;

-  If there were open access to the bay and seven boats were already fishing, would you fish in the bay?
-   If you ran the government fisheries board, how many boats would you allow out if you wanted to maximize the total profits from the bay?

# The Open Access Problem
### &lt;p style="color:#00449E"&gt;  &lt;/p&gt;

- Private boats will go out as long as **average revenue** covers costs

- By contrast, the **profit-maximizing** catch level in the industry occurs where **marginal revenue** just exceeds **marginal cost**

- Profit earned in the industry is the sum total of the difference between marginal revenue and marginal cost for each boat that goes out

- When marginal revenue is less than marginal cost, a drop in industry-wide profits will occur


---
# Resource Rents
### &lt;p style="color:#00449E"&gt;  &lt;/p&gt;

- When natural capital is used efficiently (often, MR=MC), long-run economic profits will be earned by those who retain access to the resource


- These long-run profits, generated by restricted access to natural capital, are called **resource rents**


- In an open-access fishery, the point where MR and MC curves intersect is often where the fishery is exploited to its maximum sustainable yield. 

  - Beyond this point, the costs of fishing (MC) would exceed the revenues (MR), leading to negative resource rent and depletion of the fish stock.


---
# The Open Access Problem
### &lt;p style="color:#00449E"&gt;  &lt;/p&gt;


&lt;img src="lec_figs/gp-fig3-4.png" width="75%" style="display: block; margin: auto;" /&gt;



---
# Resource Rents in New England
### &lt;p style="color:#00449E"&gt;  &lt;/p&gt;

- Data suggest that fishing off the New England coast would have to be reduced by about 70% to eliminate overfishing and achieve an efficient harvest

- This would generate a resource rent of about $130 million

- If this were collected by the government, it would be sufficient to compensate those boats put out of business due to fishing restrictions


---
# Handling the Open Access Problem
### &lt;p style="color:#00449E"&gt;  &lt;/p&gt;

- In traditional societies, informal social pressure, rules, and tradition were relied upon to prevent overexploitation

- The modern equivalent advocated by **free-market environmentalists** would be to internalize externalities through lawsuits against an offending company or individual

- So is government regulation really needed?



---
# The Public Goods Problem
### &lt;p style="color:#00449E"&gt;  &lt;/p&gt;

- Private remedies to environmental degradation (e.g., law suits) run into what economists call the **public goods problem**


- **Public goods** are goods enjoyed in common (e.g. the warning service provided by a lighthouse)


- One key characteristic of public goods is that they are **“non-excludable”** 
  - A good is **excludable** if the provider of the good can prevent people who have not paid for it from using or consuming it.
  
  
- The other key characteristic of public goods is that they are **“non-rivalrous”** 
  - A good is **rivalrous** if its consumption by one individual reduces its availability for consumption by others.

---
# The Public Goods Problem
### &lt;p style="color:#00449E"&gt;  &lt;/p&gt;


&lt;img src="lec_figs/common-public-goods.png" width="100%" style="display: block; margin: auto;" /&gt;

---
# Public Goods Problems for the Free Market
### &lt;p style="color:#00449E"&gt;  &lt;/p&gt;

- Public goods pose a problem to the free market for two reasons:

1. **Free riding**: consumers are able to utilize public goods without paying for them.

2. **High transaction costs**: the provision of public goods require groups of people to undertake action. 
  
  - In addition, information about environmental damages is costly for groups to obtain. 
  
  - These features add extra “transactions costs” making it costly to provide the public good. 



---
# An Example of Public Goods Problem
### &lt;p style="color:#00449E"&gt;  &lt;/p&gt;

- The Nature Conservancy is an organization that solicits funds to purchase and preserve wetlands and other valuable ecosystems in the US. 


- Suppose the Nature Conservancy sends a mailing to Mr. Peabody and Mr. Massey saying it needs $50 per foot to preserve the last 100 feet of a prime Appalachian trout stream. 

  - Now Peabody would be willing to pay $30 per foot and Massey $40 per foot toward the effort, for a total of $70 per foot.

  - Thus the monetary benefits of preservation exceed the costs by $20 per foot.



&lt;!-- Not necessarily.  --&gt;
&lt;!-- - Peabody, figuring Massey will pay $40 per foot, may contribute only $10 per foot.  --&gt;
&lt;!-- - Massey, following the same logic, will contribute only $20 per foot, for a total of $30 per foot.  --&gt;
&lt;!-- - As a result, each will try to free ride off the other’s provision of the 100 feet of public good, and sufficient funds will not be forthcoming. --&gt;


---
# Demand for Private and Public Goods
### &lt;p style="color:#00449E"&gt;  &lt;/p&gt;
- *With a private good*, the total demand is the *horizontal sum* of the individual demand curves

 - Each person's consumption is separate and adds to the total quantity demanded in the market.
 
 
  - For example, if Peabody wants to buy 100 feet of trout stream at $30, and Massey wants to buy 120 feet at $30, then the total quantity demanded at $30 is 220 feet.


---
# Demand for Private and Public Goods
### &lt;p style="color:#00449E"&gt;  &lt;/p&gt;

- *With a public good*, the total demand is the *vertical sum* of the individual demand curves
  - Each person's valuation of the public good is considered simultaneously since the good is non-excludable and non-rivalrous.


- For example, if Peabody is willing to pay $30 for 100 feet of stream and Massey is willing to pay $40 for the same amount, the total willingness to pay for 100 feet of stream is $70. 
  - Both can enjoy the 100 feet of stream at the same time without diminishing its value to the other.




---
# Demand for Private and Public Goods
### &lt;p style="color:#00449E"&gt;  &lt;/p&gt;


&lt;img src="lec_figs/gp-fig3-5.png" width="100%" style="display: block; margin: auto;" /&gt;




---
# Demand for Private and Public Goods
### &lt;p style="color:#00449E"&gt;  &lt;/p&gt;

- The *total* willingness to pay for public goods, 100 feet of stream, is $70.

- However, there are: 
  - Free-rider problem; 
  - High transaction costs---high cost associated with making a deal for public goods.
  
- The derivation of the total demand curve for public goods does not take into account such strategic incentives and costs.



---
# Demand for Private and Public Goods
### &lt;p style="color:#00449E"&gt;  &lt;/p&gt;
**Q**. Will the Nature Conservancy get enough in contributions to buy the land?

--

**A**. The following scenario can arise:

- Knowing that Massey is willing to pay $40, Peabody will pay $10.

- Knowing that Peabody is willing to pay $30, Massey will pay $20.

- In total, only $30 is collected, while $50 is needed.




---
# Is Sustainable Business a Solution?
### &lt;p style="color:#00449E"&gt;  &lt;/p&gt;

- **Sustainable business**: a new paradigm around economics and the environment

- Instead of viewing environmental and social problems as unwanted costs to be externalized, can business firms look at them as potential profit opportunities?



---
# Three levels of Cost-Savings
### &lt;p style="color:#00449E"&gt;  &lt;/p&gt;

- **Risk Reduction**: Firms that pro-actively reduce pollution reduce risk of regulations, legal liability, and consumer backlash

- **Resource Savings**: Firms that use water, energy, and raw materials more efficiently also reduce emissions and will often save money

- **Culture of Innovation**: Firms that see it as a part of their business to profitably solve their environmental problems create cultures that breed innovation.



---
# Challenge for the Sustainable Business Solution
### &lt;p style="color:#00449E"&gt;  &lt;/p&gt;

- Majority of firms are not focused on sustainable innovation. They can and do still raise profits by overexploiting the commons and externalizing costs.

- This leads back to the need for government policy to internalize externalities. 



---
# Summary 1
### &lt;p style="color:#00449E"&gt;  &lt;/p&gt;

- Pollution is a negative externality

- Negative externalities often arise due to open access to common property

- When access to common property resources is restricted to the efficient level, resource rents are earned

- Resource rents can be taxed to compensate those who lose from restricted access.




---
# Summary 2
### &lt;p style="color:#00449E"&gt;  &lt;/p&gt;

- Negative externalities can sometimes be internalized through lawsuits, but this runs into the …


- Public Goods Problem
  - Law suits are subject to free-riding and have high transaction costs, especially with regards to obtaining information about damages.


---
# Summary 3
### &lt;p style="color:#00449E"&gt;  &lt;/p&gt;

- Because clean-up is a public good,  government is generally expected to internalize negative externalities through: 
  
  - Regulation of access to common property.
  
  - The promotion of clean technology alternatives.


---
# Summary 4
### &lt;p style="color:#00449E"&gt;  &lt;/p&gt;

- The sustainable business movement provides hope that, through innovation, businesses can find profitable solutions to environmental and social challenges. 
  - In this way, pollution is transformed from a negative externality to a design problem.  


- But…. most firms are not focused on sustainable innovation.



---
# Summary: Bottom Line
### &lt;p style="color:#00449E"&gt;  &lt;/p&gt;

- Generally, free-market forces do not provide the right incentives to ensure that adequate care is taken to achieve an efficient level of environmental and resource protection.

- So, Government needs to step in …
