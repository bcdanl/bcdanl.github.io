# Measuring the Benefits of Environmental Protection
&lt;html&gt;&lt;div style='float:left'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;hr color='#EB811B' size=1px width=796px&gt;&lt;/html&gt;

# Introduction
### &lt;p style="color:#00449E"&gt; &lt;/p&gt;

- The benefits of pollution control can be divided into two categories:
  - **Market benefits**
	- **Nonmarket benefits**


- Nonmarket benefits are determined by inferring how much people would be willing to pay or accept for these benefits if a market for them did exist


---
# Use, Option, and Existence Value
### &lt;p style="color:#00449E"&gt; &lt;/p&gt;

- The nonmarket benefits of environmental protection: 
  - **Use**: value in use
  - **Option**: a resource has option value if the future benefits are uncertain and resource depletion is irreversible
  - **Existence**: value from the existence of a species


- Total Value = Use + Option + Existence



---
# Measuring Benefits: Consumer Surplus
### &lt;p style="color:#00449E"&gt; &lt;/p&gt;


The benefit measure for pollution reduction is the increase in **consumer surplus** (CS) due to such a reduction

CS is &lt;u&gt;the difference between what one is willing to pay and what one actually has to pay for a service or a project&lt;/u&gt;

--

&lt;img src="lec_figs/gp-fig5-1.png" width="50%" style="display: block; margin: auto;" /&gt;



---
# Measuring Benefits: WTP and WTA
### &lt;p style="color:#00449E"&gt; &lt;/p&gt;

- There are two ways to determine CS using utility levels:
  - **Willingness-to-pay (WTP)** for improved quality
  - **Willingness-to-accept (WTA)** compensation in exchange for degraded quality


--

- More precisely,
  - WTP measures the monetary value one is willing to pay to attain enhanced quality, while maintaining the same level of utility experienced prior to the enhancement.
  
  - WTA measures the monetary compensation one is willing to accept to forgo the improved quality, ensuring that the level of utility remains as what it would be with the quality improvement.


---
# Compensating Variation (CV) and Equivalent Variation (EV)
### &lt;p style="color:#00449E"&gt; CV and EV for the change in environmental quality &lt;/p&gt;

.pull-left[
- `\(q\)` : a public good (e.g., improvement in environmental quality)
- `\(x_1\)`: a market good with price `\(p_1\)`
- `\(y\)`: income to buy `\(x_{1}\)`.


- Compensating variation (CV) measures WTP.
- Equivalent variation (EV) measures WTA.
]

.pull-right[
&lt;img src="lec_figs/cv-ev-q.png" width="100%" style="display: block; margin: auto;" /&gt;
]


---
# Problem with WTA and WTP
### &lt;p style="color:#00449E"&gt; &lt;/p&gt;

- In standard theory, WTA should be only a bit higher than WTP for most goods, given small income effects.



- In experiments, WTA values are typically 2 to 7 times as high as WTP values! 
  - This difference persists even in tests specifically designed to control for inflated WTA figures


---
# Explaining WTP/WTA Disparities:
### &lt;p style="color:#00449E"&gt; &lt;/p&gt;

*1*. **Prospect theory**: people may adopt the *status quo* as their *reference point* and demand higher compensation to allow environmental degradation than they are willing to pay to make improvements

- If prospect theory is correct, it would reshape our marginal benefit curve for pollution reduction

--

&lt;img src="lec_figs/gp-fig5-2.png" width="48%" style="display: block; margin: auto;" /&gt;


---
# Explaining WTP/WTA Disparities:
### &lt;p style="color:#00449E"&gt; &lt;/p&gt;

*2*. **Substitution**. The degree of substitutability between environmental quality and other consumption goods
  - If environmental goods really have no good substitutes, this could explain the difference.

.pull-left[
&lt;img src="lec_figs/gp-fig5a-1.png" width="70%" style="display: block; margin: auto;" /&gt;
]
.pull-right[
&lt;img src="lec_figs/gp-fig5a-2.png" width="73%" style="display: block; margin: auto;" /&gt;
]

&lt;!-- For example, if we were to compare WTP with WTA for tickets for two ice hockey games, one of which was also being live on TV, we might expect the difference between WTP and WTA to be smaller for the game that people could watch live on TV instead of only being able to watch it live at the stadium. If there are no close substitutes, then we could expect quite large differences between WTP and WTA, whereas if close substitutes exist, then WTP and WTA should not be that different.  --&gt;

&lt;!-- The second explanation is rooted in behavioural psychology, in the concept of loss aversion. This concept suggests that people systematically value what they already have more highly than that which they could acquire, so that losses are always valued more highly than equivalent gains. --&gt;

---
# Prospect Theory or Substitutability?
### &lt;p style="color:#00449E"&gt; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;!-- - One study using candy bars and risk of salmonella from sandwiches, to determine peoples’ WTA and WTP. --&gt;
&lt;!--   - Provided support for the “no-good substitutes” explanation for the WTA/WTP discrepancy --&gt;


- Advocates of prospect theory argue people do not become as attached to a candy bar or sandwich as they do to a grove of trees in a local park

- People are attached to the status quo because there are no good substitutes for environmental degradation from the status quo

- In this sense, the two explanations can converge




---
# WTP/WTA Disparities: Which to Use?
### &lt;p style="color:#00449E"&gt; &lt;/p&gt;

- The standard practice is to use WTP because WTA estimates may be less reliable

- But if we think of common property as belonging to “the people” then WTA may be the best measurement





---
# Next Step: Risk Assessment and Perception
### &lt;p style="color:#00449E"&gt; &lt;/p&gt;

- Step 1 in measuring the benefits of pollution reduction: 
  - Assess the risks.


- Information on health risks come from two sources:
  - Epidemiological: studying past cases of human exposure 
  - Animal studies from laboratories


- Epidemiological studies: 
  - Expensive, uncommon and hard to do well.


- Animal studies: require translating information from high-dose animal studies to low dose human exposure, creating multiple uncertainties



---
# Risk Comparisons: peanut butter?!
### &lt;p style="color:#00449E"&gt; &lt;/p&gt;


&lt;img src="lec_figs/gp-tab5-1.png" width="100%" style="display: block; margin: auto;" /&gt;


---
# Risk Example: PCBs
### &lt;p style="color:#00449E"&gt; &lt;/p&gt;

- Epidemiological studies have shown that 
  - PCBs cause developmental abnormalities such as low birth weights and less developed cognitive and motor weights; 
  - Exposure to PCBs are correlated with certain cancers


- In animal studies, PCBs have been found to generate cancers


- EPA: PCBs are “probable human carcinogens,” causing cancer.


---
# Perceived Risk
### &lt;p style="color:#00449E"&gt; &lt;/p&gt;

- Individuals may perceive risk differently than the actual risk for a few reasons:

  - Voluntary vs involuntary risk
  
  - Lack of knowledge
  
  - Distrust of Experts
  
  - People are risk averse



---
# Risk Aversion
### &lt;p style="color:#00449E"&gt; &lt;/p&gt;

- An individual is risk averse if they prefer a “sure thing” to a gamble with a higher expected payoff: 
  - E.g., If I prefer $50 for sure versus a 50% chance for $110, I am risk averse.


- **Risk aversion**: people dislike exposure to catastrophic events occurring w/ low probability more than unpleasant events occurring w/ high probability– even if they have the same average cost.

&lt;img src="lec_figs/gp-tab5-2.png" width="85%" style="display: block; margin: auto;" /&gt;



---
# Measuring Benefits: Three Methods
### &lt;p style="color:#00449E"&gt; &lt;/p&gt;

- **Stated Preference**: value of benefits obtained from  survey methods
  - *1*. **Contingent Valuation** Analysis


- **Revealed Preference**: value of benefits inferred from observed market data
  - *2*. **Travel Cost** Analysis
  - *3*. **Hedonic Regression** Analysis



---
# Measuring Benefits: Contingent Valuation
### &lt;p style="color:#00449E"&gt; &lt;/p&gt;

- Contingent valuation:

  - Survey methods used by economists to determine the benefits of environmental protection; 

  - The survey responses are “contingent” upon the questions asked
  
  - Basically,  ask people their WTP and/or WTA


---
# The Contingent Valuation Method: 
### &lt;p style="color:#00449E"&gt; Example of Oil Tank Clean-up &lt;/p&gt;


&lt;img src="lec_figs/gp-fig5-3.png" width="47%" style="display: block; margin: auto;" /&gt;




---
# Sources of Error in Contingent Valuations
### &lt;p style="color:#00449E"&gt; &lt;/p&gt;

- **Hypothetical Bias**
  - Hypothetical questions `\(\rightarrow\)` hypothetical responses


- **Free-riding**
  - May lead understatement of true WTP


- **Strategic Bias**
  - People might inflate their WTP to achieve greater clean-up if they believe they will not have to pay their WTP


- **Embedding Bias**
  - Answers are strongly affected by the context provided about the issue at stake: MAIN PROBLEM!



---
# Contingent Valuation: useful or useless? 
### &lt;p style="color:#00449E"&gt; &lt;/p&gt;

- Economists disagree about the reliability of contingent valuation analysis. Doing a ‘state of the art’ job can be very expensive 

- Contingent valuations provide the only available means for estimating the existence value component of nonmarket benefits, so they are widely used




---
# Measuring Benefits: Travel Cost
### &lt;p style="color:#00449E"&gt; &lt;/p&gt;

- The travel-cost method measures the amount of money that people expend to use the resource (parks, rivers, or beaches)

- By relating differences in travel cost to differences in consumption, a demand curve for the resource can be derived and consumer surplus estimated



---
# Demand Curve Derived from Travel-Cost Data: example
### &lt;p style="color:#00449E"&gt; &lt;/p&gt;

&amp;\text{Total Consumer Surplus} \\

&amp;\quad+ \text{Area B surplus}\\ 
&amp;\quad+ \text{Area C surplus}\\

&amp;\quad+ 1,000 \text{ people} * [(d + e) – 6 * 25]\\
&amp;\quad+ 1,000 \text{ people} * (d – 50)
\end{align}`
$$

# Problems With the Travel Cost Method
### &lt;p style="color:#00449E"&gt; &lt;/p&gt;

- People have different opportunity costs

- Some may have alternative recreational opportunities that others do not

- The travel cost method has been extended to address both of these issues


---
# Example: The value of Florida Beaches
### &lt;p style="color:#00449E"&gt;  &lt;/p&gt;

- Survey 826 tourists: 
  - Days spent at the beach and expenses incurred to use the beach, meals, travel and access fees, initial travel costs in and out of the state, length of stay, age, income, and other control data.


- Hypothesis:  
  - Lower beach expenses `\(\rightarrow\)`  greater number of days at the beach,
  - Holding all the other factors constant


- Results: 
  - A 10% increase in “price” lead to a 1.5% decrease in time on the beach.    - Average CS per day of $38. 
  - Over 2 million tourists: $2.37 billion per year. 




---
# Measuring Benefits: Hedonic Regression
### &lt;p style="color:#00449E"&gt;  &lt;/p&gt;

- **Hedonic regression** uses the change in price from related (complementary) goods to infer a WTP for a healthier environment


- Confusing label! 
  - Hedonic = “pertaining to pleasure”


- A hedonic regression estimates the pleasure or utility associated with an improved environment


---
# Hedonic Regression Example 1: 
### &lt;p style="color:#00449E"&gt; Property Values and Pollution &lt;/p&gt;

- Compare change in prices for houses sold before and after contamination became public. 
  - Control for all other factors affecting home costs. 


- In New Bedford, MA, houses closest to the contaminated area: price declines of $9,000; 
  - In area of secondary pollution, declines of $7,000.  
  - Total damages to home-owners: $36 million 



---
# Hedonic Regression Example 2: 
### &lt;p style="color:#00449E"&gt; The Value of a Human Life ? &lt;/p&gt;

- The most ethically charged aspect of benefit-cost analysis is its requirement that we put a monetary value on reduced risk of death.


- Old approach, still used in court settlements: lifetime earnings. 
  - Retired or disabled person is “worth” $0. 


- Economic Approach: “wage-risk studies.”

---
# Hedonic Regression Example 2: 
### &lt;p style="color:#00449E"&gt; The Value of a Statistical Life (VSL) &lt;/p&gt;

- Isolate the wage premium people are paid to accept risk jobs---police officer, firefighter, coal miner


- With this, it is possible to estimate a WTP a reduction in the risk of death, and implicitly, the value of a statistical life (VSL)


- Holding all else equal, suppose we observe that police officers receive extra pay of $700/yr. 
  - If the excess risk of death is 1/10,000 per year, 10,000 officers can collectively trade one of their lives each year for $700*10,000=$7 million, the VSL for a police officer.




---
# The Value of a Statistical Life
### &lt;p style="color:#00449E"&gt; Problems  &lt;/p&gt;

- Accurate information
  - Individuals might underestimate or overestimate risk of death


- Sample selection bias
  - People accepting risky jobs are not likely representative of the “average” person with preference toward risk-aversion


- Involuntary nature of risk
  - People may require more to accept risk imposed upon them without their consent



---
# The Value of a Statistical Life
### &lt;p style="color:#00449E"&gt;  &lt;/p&gt;

- The value obtained from a hedonic regression is not the value of a specific life
  - We would pay just about anything to save our own life or that of a loved one!


- Instead, this is the amount of money the average individual in a society requires to accept a higher risk of death



---
# Morally OK?
### &lt;p style="color:#00449E"&gt;  &lt;/p&gt;

- As with any measure of consumer surplus, this method will put a much larger value on life for folks from rich than from poor countries.

  - USA: $7 million
  
  - Pakistan: $300,000
