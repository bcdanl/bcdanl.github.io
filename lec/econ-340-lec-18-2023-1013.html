### Byeong-Hak Choe
### October 13, 2023

# Announcement
### &lt;p style="color:#00449E"&gt; Grading on the Curve &lt;/p&gt;

- Suppose Byeong-Hak wants to make the highest and the lowest scores 100 and 70 after scaling, respectively.

  - The scaling formula for student `\(i\)`'s raw score is then as follows:

$$
`\begin{align}
(\text{Scaled Score}_{i}) \,=\, \left(\frac{(\text{Raw Score}_{i}) \,-\,\min\{\text{Raw Scores}\} }{\max\{\text{Raw Scores}\}\,-\,\min\{\text{Raw Scores}\}}\right)\times(100 - 70) + 70 
\end{align}`
$$

# Announcement
### &lt;p style="color:#00449E"&gt;  &lt;/p&gt;


&lt;img src="lec_figs/dist-econ340-exam-1.png" width="75%" style="display: block; margin: auto;" /&gt;

- Historical distribution of letter grades in Byeong-Hak's courses has been similar to the school's one.

---
# Announcement
### &lt;p style="color:#00449E"&gt; Changes in Syllabus &lt;/p&gt;

- The midterm exam score is the maximum between (1) the simple average of the two midterm exam scores, and (2) the weighted average of them with one-fourth weight on the midterm exam 1 score and three-third weight on the midterm exam 2 score:

$$
`\begin{align}
(\text{Midterm Score}) =\, &amp;\text{max}\,\left\{0.50\times(\text{Midterm 1 Score}) \,+\, 0.50\times(\text{Midterm 2 Score})\right.,\notag\\ 
&amp;\qquad\;\,\left.0.25\times(\text{Midterm 1 Score}) \,+\, 0.75\times(\text{Midterm 2 Score})\right\}.\notag
\end{align}`
$$

- The coverage of the Midterm Exam 2 as well as the Final Exam will be **cumulative**.



---
# Announcement
### &lt;p style="color:#00449E"&gt; Grading &lt;/p&gt;

- The total exam score is the maximum between (1) the simple average of the midterm exam score and the final exam score, and (2) the weighted average of them with one-fourth weight on the midterm exam score and three-third weight on the final exam score:

$$
`\begin{align}
(\text{Total Exam Score}) =\, &amp;\text{max}\,\left\{0.50\times(\text{Midterm Score}) \,+\, 0.50\times(\text{Final Score})\right.,\notag\\ 
&amp;\qquad\;\,\left.0.25\times(\text{Midterm Score}) \,+\, 0.75\times(\text{Final Score})\right\}.\notag
\end{align}`
$$



---
# Announcement
### &lt;p style="color:#00449E"&gt; Grading &lt;/p&gt;
- Homework assignments account for 20% of the total percentage grade. 
- The midterm exams and the final exam account for 60% of the total percentage grade. 
- The term paper accounts for 20% of the total grade. 
- Attendance accounts for 5% of the total percentage grade.

$$
`\begin{align}
(\text{Total Percentage Grade}) =&amp;\;\, 0.05\times(\text{Attendance}) \,+\, 0.20\times(\text{Homework})\notag\\ &amp; \,+\, 0.60\times(\text{Exams}) \,+\, 0.20\times(\text{Term Paper}).\notag
\end{align}`
$$


---
# Announcement
### &lt;p style="color:#00449E"&gt; Grading &lt;/p&gt;

- Due to the weighting schemes in calculating the total exam score, the percentage of Midterm Exam 1 Score accounts for either 3.75%, 7.5%, or 15% out of the Total Percentage Grade.



- The single lowest homework score will be dropped when calculating the total homework score. 
  - Each homework except for the homework with the lowest score accounts for 20% of the total homework score.



---
# Announcement
### &lt;p style="color:#00449E"&gt; Grading &lt;/p&gt;

The term paper score is calculated as follows:
$$
`\begin{align}
(\text{Term Paper Score}) =&amp;\quad\;\; 0.15\times(\text{Byeong-Hak Choe's evaluation on Proposal}) \notag\\
&amp;\,+\,0.15\times(\text{Byeong-Hak Choe's evaluation on Presentation}) \notag\\
&amp;\,+\, 0.05\times(\text{Average of peer evaluations on Presentation}) \notag\\
&amp;\,+\, 0.65\times(\text{Byeong-Hak Choe's evaluation on Term Paper}) \notag
\end{align}`
$$

# Measuring the Benefits of Environmental Protection
&lt;html&gt;&lt;div style='float:left'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;hr color='#EB811B' size=1px width=796px&gt;&lt;/html&gt;


---
# Measuring Benefits: Three Methods
### &lt;p style="color:#00449E"&gt; &lt;/p&gt;

- **Stated Preference**: value of benefits obtained from  survey methods
  - *1*. **Contingent Valuation** Analysis


- **Revealed Preference**: value of benefits inferred from observed market data
  - *2*. **Travel Cost** Analysis
  - *3*. **Hedonic Regression** Analysis



---
# Measuring Benefits: Hedonic Regression
### &lt;p style="color:#00449E"&gt;  &lt;/p&gt;

- **Hedonic regression** uses the change in price from related (complementary) goods to infer a WTP for a healthier environment


- Confusing label! 
  - Hedonic = “pertaining to pleasure”


- A hedonic regression estimates the pleasure or utility associated with an improved environment


---
# Hedonic Regression Example 1: 
### &lt;p style="color:#00449E"&gt; Property Values and Pollution &lt;/p&gt;


.panelset[
.panel[.panel-name[Hedonic Model]
- Compare change in prices for houses sold before and after contamination became public. 
  - Control for all other factors affecting home costs. 

$$
`\begin{align}
Price_{i, t} = \beta_{0} + \beta_{1}PCB_{i, t} + \mathbf{\beta}X_{i,t} + \epsilon_{i, t}
\end{align}`
$$
- `\(i\)`: House `\(i\)`
- `\(t\)`: Time `\(t\)`
- `\(PCB\)`: whether or not the house `\(i\)` in time `\(t\)` is known to be PCB-contaminated 
- `\(X_{i,t}\)`: House `\(i\)`'s characteristics in time `\(t\)`

]
.panel[.panel-name[Result]

- In New Bedford, MA, houses closest to the contaminated area: price declines of $9,000; 
  - In area of secondary pollution, declines of $7,000.  
  - Total damages to home-owners: $36 million

# Hedonic Regression Example 2: 
### &lt;p style="color:#00449E"&gt; The Value of a Human Life ? &lt;/p&gt;

- The most ethically charged aspect of benefit-cost analysis is its requirement that we put a monetary value on reduced risk of death.


- Old approach, still used in court settlements: lifetime earnings. 
  - Retired or disabled person is “worth” $0. 


- Economic Approach: “wage-risk studies.”

---
# Hedonic Regression Example 2: 
### &lt;p style="color:#00449E"&gt; The Value of a Statistical Life (VSL) &lt;/p&gt;

- Isolate the wage premium people are paid to accept risk jobs---police officer, firefighter, coal miner


- With this, it is possible to estimate a WTP/WTA for a reduction in the risk of death, and implicitly, the **value of a statistical life** (VSL)


- Holding all else equal, suppose we observe that police officers receive extra pay of $700/yr. 
  - If the excess risk of death is 1/10,000 per year, 10,000 officers can collectively trade one of their lives each year for `\(700 \div (\frac{1}{10,000})= 7,000,000\)`.



---
# The Value of a Statistical Life (VSL)
### &lt;p style="color:#00449E"&gt; VSL Policy &lt;/p&gt;


.panelset[

.panel[.panel-name[VSL Benefit]

- When we analyze the value of environmental improvement, we clearly must include as one of the most important benefits reduction in human mortality.

- Some researcher estimate that up to 70% of benefits across all government ruls are due to mortality reductions valued using the VSL.
]


.panel[.panel-name[DOT]
- Department of Transportation

  - Policy requires base VSL of $6.0 million in 2009, with supplementary analyses at $3.2 million and $8.4 million (last set in 2008).

]

.panel[.panel-name[DHS]
- Department of Homeland Security

  - No department-wide policy. 
  
  - Some agencies (e.g, TSA) tend to follow DOT's policy.
  
  - A report to Customs and Border Protection in 2008 recommended base VSL of $63 million, with supplementary analyses at $4.9 million and $7.9 million.

]

.panel[.panel-name[EPA]
- EPA

  - Policy requires base VSL of $7.4 million (in 2006 dollars).
  
  - This statistic results from 27 studies published between 1974 and 1991. 
  
  - EPA acknowledges these studies are dated and says it is currently considering more recent studies as it evaluates approaches to revise its guidelines.

]

.panel[.panel-name[DHHS]
- Department of Health and Human Services

  - No department-wide policy. 
  
  - FDA has no policy, but tends to follow EPA's VSL policy. 
  
  - Centers for Medicare &amp; Medicaid Services has no policy, but in 2008 used $5 million VSL from a 2006 FDA rule.

]

.panel[.panel-name[OSHA]
- Occupational Safety and Health Administration

  - No agency-wide policy, but OSHA used EPA's VSL of $6.8 million in a 2006 rule that reportedly describes OSHA's general approach.

# The Value of a Statistical Life
### &lt;p style="color:#00449E"&gt; Problems  &lt;/p&gt;

- Accurate information
  - Individuals might underestimate or overestimate risk of death


- Sample selection bias
  - People accepting risky jobs are not likely representative of the “average” person with preference toward risk-aversion


- Involuntary nature of risk
  - When risks are imposed on individuals without their consent, they may value their safety more and require higher compensation to accept those risks.


---
# The Value of a Statistical Life
### &lt;p style="color:#00449E"&gt;  &lt;/p&gt;

- The value obtained from a wage hedonic regression on mortality risk is not the value of a specific life.
  - We would pay just about anything to save our own life or that of a loved one!


- VSL is the amount of money the *average* individual in a society requires to accept a higher risk of death from environmental degradation.


---
# Morally OK?
### &lt;p style="color:#00449E"&gt;  &lt;/p&gt;

- As with any measure of consumer surplus, this method will put a much larger value on life for folks from rich than from poor countries.
  - USA: $7 million
  - Pakistan: $300,000


- Poor people are willing to accept riskier jobs at much lower wages.
  - Reductions in the risk of death emerge in this benefit-cost framework as much less valuable to them.




---
# Morally OK?
### &lt;p style="color:#00449E"&gt;  &lt;/p&gt;


- To what extent are labor market choices to accept higher risk really “choices”?
  

E.g., *12-year-old Vicente Guerrero spends most of his time on dirtier work: smearing glue onto the soles of shoes with his hands. The can of glue he dips his fingers into is marked “toxic substances... prolonged or repeated inhalation causes grave health damage; do not leave in the reach of minors.” All the boys ignore the warning.*
  

- Vicente works at his father’s urging to supplement the family income with his wages of about $6 per day.





---
# Morally OK?
### &lt;p style="color:#00449E"&gt;  &lt;/p&gt;

- Valuing life by the “acceptance” of risk in exchange for higher wages reflects the income bias built into any market-based measure of environmental benefits.


- There is a debate over whether VSL should be adjusted for income, age, health, and type of death (e.g., sudden, cancer, voluntary or involuntary risk).
