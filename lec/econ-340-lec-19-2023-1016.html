# Hedonic Regression Example 1: 
### &lt;p style="color:#00449E"&gt; Property Values and Pollution &lt;/p&gt;


.panelset[
.panel[.panel-name[Hedonic Model]

- Harrison, D. and Rubinfeld, D.L. (1978) Hedonic prices and the demand for clean air. J. Environ. Economics and Management 5, 81–102.

  - Control for all other factors affecting home costs. 

$$
`\begin{align}
HomeValue_{i} = \beta_{0} + \beta_{1}NOX_{i} + \mathbf{\beta}X_{i} + \epsilon_{i}
\end{align}`
$$
- `\(i\)`: House `\(i\)`
- `\(NOX\)`: nitrogen oxides concentration (parts per 10 million).
- `\(X_{i}\)`: Vector of house `\(i\)`'s characteristics

]
.panel[.panel-name[Result]

- In Boston, MA, one unit increase is `NOX` was associated with a decrease in `HomeValue` by $17,829, all else being equal.

]

# Hedonic Regression Example 2: 
### &lt;p style="color:#00449E"&gt; The Value of a Human Life ? &lt;/p&gt;

- The most ethically charged aspect of benefit-cost analysis is its requirement that we put a monetary value on reduced risk of death.


- Old approach, still used in court settlements: lifetime earnings. 
  - Retired or disabled person is “worth” $0. 


- Economic Approach: “wage-risk studies.”

---
# Hedonic Regression Example 2: 
### &lt;p style="color:#00449E"&gt; The Value of a Statistical Life (VSL) &lt;/p&gt;



.panelset[

.panel[.panel-name[VSL]
- Isolate the wage premium people are paid to accept risk jobs---police officer, firefighter, coal miner


- With this, it is possible to estimate a WTP/WTA for the risk of death, and implicitly, the **value of a statistical life** (VSL)


- Holding all else equal, suppose we observe that police officers receive extra pay of $700/yr. 
  - If the excess risk of death is 1/10,000 per year, 10,000 officers can collectively trade one of their lives each year for `\(700 \div (\frac{1}{10,000})= 7,000,000\)`.

]

.panel[.panel-name[Statistical Life]
  
- Since this reduction in risk would mean that we would expect one fewer death among the sample of 10,000 people over the year on average, this is sometimes described as "one statistical life saved.”

-  This is NOT an estimate of how much money any single individual or group would be willing to pay to prevent the certain death of any particular person.
]
]

---
# Hedonic Regression Example 2: 
### &lt;p style="color:#00449E"&gt; Is VSL WTP or WTA? Can VSL be both? &lt;/p&gt;

.panelset[

.panel[.panel-name[WTP]
- Imagine there's a safety measure that can be introduced in cars which would decrease the probability of fatal accidents by 0.001% (or 1 in 100,000). 

- If individuals in a population of 100,000 are each willing to pay $100 for this reduction in risk, then the total amount paid by the entire population for that tiny risk reduction would be $10 million (100,000 people `\(\times\)` $100/person). 

- In this scenario, the VSL is $10 million, even though no specific life is guaranteed to be saved; rather, it's a statistical reduction in risk across the population.
]

.panel[.panel-name[WTA]
- Consider workers in a hazardous industry. 

- If workers demand a wage premium of $500 per year to accept a job with a 0.01% (or 1 in 10,000) higher risk of fatality compared to a safer job, then the VSL, based on this wage-risk trade-off, would be $5 million (10,000 multiplied by $500).

]

]


---
# The Value of a Statistical Life (VSL)
### &lt;p style="color:#00449E"&gt; VSL Policy &lt;/p&gt;


.panelset[

.panel[.panel-name[VSL Benefit]

- When we analyze the value of environmental improvement, we clearly must include as one of the most important benefits reduction in human mortality.

- Some researcher estimate that up to 70% of benefits across all government ruls are due to mortality reductions valued using the VSL.
]


.panel[.panel-name[DOT]
- Department of Transportation

  - Policy requires base VSL of $6.0 million in 2009, with supplementary analyses at $3.2 million and $8.4 million (last set in 2008).

]

.panel[.panel-name[DHS]
- Department of Homeland Security

  - No department-wide policy. 
  
  - Some agencies (e.g, TSA) tend to follow DOT's policy.
  
  - A report to Customs and Border Protection in 2008 recommended base VSL of $63 million, with supplementary analyses at $4.9 million and $7.9 million.

]

.panel[.panel-name[EPA]
- EPA

  - Policy requires base VSL of $7.4 million (in 2006 dollars).
  
  - This statistic results from 27 studies published between 1974 and 1991. 
  
  - EPA acknowledges these studies are dated and says it is currently considering more recent studies as it evaluates approaches to revise its guidelines.

]

.panel[.panel-name[DHHS]
- Department of Health and Human Services

  - No department-wide policy. 
  
  - FDA has no policy, but tends to follow EPA's VSL policy. 
  
  - Centers for Medicare &amp; Medicaid Services has no policy, but in 2008 used $5 million VSL from a 2006 FDA rule.

]

.panel[.panel-name[OSHA]
- Occupational Safety and Health Administration

  - No agency-wide policy, but OSHA used EPA's VSL of $6.8 million in a 2006 rule that reportedly describes OSHA's general approach.

# The Value of a Statistical Life
### &lt;p style="color:#00449E"&gt; Problems  &lt;/p&gt;

- Accurate information
  - Individuals might underestimate or overestimate risk of death
  - E.g., People may systematically overstate the probability of low-risk deaths and understate the probability of high-risk deaths.
  
  

- Sample selection bias
  - People accepting risky jobs are not likely representative of the “average” person with preference toward risk-aversion


- Involuntary nature of risk
  - When risks are imposed on individuals without their consent, they may value their safety more and require higher compensation to accept those risks.


---
# The Value of a Statistical Life
### &lt;p style="color:#00449E"&gt;  &lt;/p&gt;

- The value obtained from a wage hedonic regression on mortality risk is not the value of a specific life.
  - We would pay just about anything to save our own life or that of a loved one!


- VSL is the amount of money the *average* individual in a society requires to accept a higher risk of death from environmental degradation.


---
# Morally OK?
### &lt;p style="color:#00449E"&gt;  &lt;/p&gt;

- As with any measure of consumer surplus, this method will put a much larger value on life for folks from rich than from poor countries.
  - USA: $7 million
  - Pakistan: $300,000


- Poor people are willing to accept riskier jobs at much lower wages.
  - Reductions in the risk of death emerge in this benefit-cost framework as much less valuable to them.




---
# Morally OK?
### &lt;p style="color:#00449E"&gt;  &lt;/p&gt;


- To what extent are labor market choices to accept higher risk really “choices”?
  

E.g., *12-year-old Vicente Guerrero spends most of his time on dirtier work: smearing glue onto the soles of shoes with his hands. The can of glue he dips his fingers into is marked “toxic substances... prolonged or repeated inhalation causes grave health damage; do not leave in the reach of minors.” All the boys ignore the warning.*
  

- Vicente works at his father’s urging to supplement the family income with his wages of about $6 per day.





---
# Morally OK?
### &lt;p style="color:#00449E"&gt;  &lt;/p&gt;

- Valuing life by the “acceptance” of risk in exchange for higher wages reflects the income bias built into any market-based measure of environmental benefits.


- There is a debate over whether VSL should be adjusted for income, age, health, and type of death (e.g., sudden, cancer, voluntary or involuntary risk).

# Measuring the Costs of Environmental Protection
&lt;html&gt;&lt;div style='float:left'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;hr color='#EB811B' size=1px width=796px&gt;&lt;/html&gt;



---
# The Engineering Approach
### &lt;p style="color:#00449E"&gt;  &lt;/p&gt;

- Engineering approach to measuring costs

  - Add up all the expected expenditures by firms plus state, local, and federal governmental on pollution control and regulatory efforts
  
  - By far the most widespread method in use
  
  - Require making assumptions about future behavior: technologies adopted, compliance rates, etc.

# Pollution Abatement Costs and Expenditures (PACE): 2005 Survey
### &lt;p style="color:#00449E"&gt;  &lt;/p&gt;

- "The [PACE survey](https://www.epa.gov/environmental-economics/pollution-abatement-costs-and-expenditures-2005-survey) is the most comprehensive source of information on capital expenditures and operating costs associated with pollution abatement for facilities in the U.S. manufacturing industry. The Census Bureau conducted the PACE survey from 1973 to 1994."


- Revised in collaboration with EPA in 1999. Revised again for 2005,


- Covers approximately 20,000 plants in manufacturing industries, with the exception of Apparel. Plants with less than 20 employees are excluded.


- Used to measure abatement expenditures in many econometric analyses.



---
# Pollution Abatement Costs and Expenditures (PACE): 2005 Survey
### &lt;p style="color:#00449E"&gt;  &lt;/p&gt;
- Pollution abatement operating costs: $20.7 billion


- Abatement capital expenditures: $5.9 billion


- Value of shipments: $4,735 billion
  - Abatement costs are 0.56% of the value of shipments
  - About 1% for petroleum &amp; coal (NAICS 324) &amp; chemical manufacturing (325)


- Air pollution abatement ($12.5) is a bit larger than water ($8.1) or solid waste ($6)


- Air pollution expenditures are largest for petroleum-coal &amp; chemical manufacturing.

&lt;img src="lec_figs/gp-fig6-1.png" width="80%" style="display: block; margin: auto;" /&gt;





---
# Opportunity Cost
### &lt;p style="color:#00449E"&gt;  &lt;/p&gt;

- The value that resources generate in their next best available use

- Only opportunity costs measure the true cost of environmental protection




---
# Overstatement of True Costs
### &lt;p style="color:#00449E"&gt;  &lt;/p&gt;

- Engineering cost estimates &lt;u&gt;will overstate true social opportunity costs&lt;/u&gt; to the extent that environmental policies:

  - Increase productivity 
  
  - Reduce structural unemployment




---
# Understatement of True Costs
### &lt;p style="color:#00449E"&gt;  &lt;/p&gt;

- Engineering cost estimates will &lt;u&gt;understate true social opportunity costs&lt;/u&gt; to the extent that environmental policy:
  
  - Lowers productivity growth
  
  - Induces structural unemployment
  
  - Increases monopoly power in the economy




---
# Productivity Impacts of Regulation
### &lt;p style="color:#00449E"&gt;  &lt;/p&gt;

- The biggest unknown in estimating the costs of environmental protection is its impact on productivity

- Some argue that environmental regulations have been a major contributor to the productivity slowdown

- Others argue that pollution control efforts spur productivity growth by forcing firms to become more efficient




---
# Pro-Productivity Effects of Regulation
### &lt;p style="color:#00449E"&gt;  &lt;/p&gt;

*1*. Improving the short-run efficiency of resource use, saving money for firms


*2*. Encouraging firms to invest more, or invest “smarter” for the long run
  - Porter Hypothesis: regulation, enhances long-run competitiveness
  - Regulation may play a technology-forcing role.


*3*. Reducing health-care costs or improving ecosystem services , which frees up capital for long-run investment




---
# Anti-Productivity Effects of Regulation
### &lt;p style="color:#00449E"&gt;  &lt;/p&gt;

- Regulation imposes direct costs on regulated firms that may crowd out investment in conventional capital

- Slowdown in new investment may occur when regulation is more stringent for new sources of pollution (“grandfathering”)

- Regulation will cause higher prices for important economy-wide inputs, further crowding out investment

- Regulation may frustrate entrepreneurial activity– too much “red tape”




---
# The Cost of Regulation: Productivity Studies
### &lt;p style="color:#00449E"&gt;  &lt;/p&gt;


- Some data: (Barbara and McConnel)

  - 10% to 30% of the productivity decline in heavily regulated industries could be accounted for by environmental regulation

  - Less than 10% to 20% of the post 1970 slowdown can be attributed to environmental regulation





---
# Employment Impacts of Regulation
### &lt;p style="color:#00449E"&gt;  &lt;/p&gt;

- Is job loss a “hidden cost” of environmental protection? 

- Or, is environmental protection the key to  sustainable economic development and “green jobs”?





---
# Jobs-Environment Trade-Off?
### &lt;p style="color:#00449E"&gt;  &lt;/p&gt;

- Most of the time, if you hear a sentence that begins with “All economists agree,” you should head for the door

- But in this case, there is an agreement that at the economy-wide level there is simply no such thing as a jobs-environment trade-off




---
# Rhetoric around the 1990 Clean Air Act Amendments:
### &lt;p style="color:#00449E"&gt;  &lt;/p&gt;

- “A minimum of 200,000 jobs will be quickly lost; this number could easily exceed one or two million”

- It would “move the United States towards the status of a second-class industrial power by the end of the century”

- Actual Job Loss: About 5,000 total spread out over several states, and several years 





---
# Key Lessons Learned About Job Impacts
### &lt;p style="color:#00449E"&gt;  &lt;/p&gt;

1. At the economy-wide level there is no trade-off between jobs and the environment

2. Actual layoffs from environmental protection have been small (about 2,000-3,000 jobs per year)

3. Pollution intensive firms are not fleeing rich countries in large numbers to escape environmental regulation

4. Green Jobs: Environmental Protection spending can boost net job growth when the economy is not at full employment.





---
# Economy-wide Effects
### &lt;p style="color:#00449E"&gt;  &lt;/p&gt;

- Regulation does not create long-run unemployment; 
  
  - Instead, it will contribute to a shift in the type of jobs the economy creates: 
  
  - Eg, total solar jobs, which barely existed ten years ago, now exceed total oil and gas jobs and are much greater than total coal jobs. 









---
# What about layoffs from Regulation?
### &lt;p style="color:#00449E"&gt;  &lt;/p&gt;


&lt;img src="lec_figs/gp-tab6-2.png" width="75%" style="display: block; margin: auto;" /&gt;




---
# Layoffs Due to Regulation
### &lt;p style="color:#00449E"&gt;  &lt;/p&gt;

- Employer estimates: environmental regulation accounts for less than one tenth of one percent of all mass layoffs nationwide

- 7 plants per year closed primarily as a result of environmental problems

- On average, 2,000-3,000 lost positions each year are due in part to environmental regulation– data consistent year after year. 

- 40 times more layoffs are due to ownership changes than to regulation





---
# The Coal Case
### &lt;p style="color:#00449E"&gt;  &lt;/p&gt;


&lt;img src="lec_figs/coal-prod-emp.png" width="100%" style="display: block; margin: auto;" /&gt;

- Technological Change / Competition from Natural Gas &amp; Renewables / Environmental and Climate Regulations


---
# The Coal Case
### &lt;p style="color:#00449E"&gt;  &lt;/p&gt;


&lt;img src="lec_figs/coal-prod-emp2.png" width="100%" style="display: block; margin: auto;" /&gt;

---
# Pollution Havens?
### &lt;p style="color:#00449E"&gt;  &lt;/p&gt;

- Does pollution intensive industry flee to poor countries with less stringent environmental regulation—”pollution havens“?

- Very few U.S. manufacturing firms have shut down due to environmental regulation, and then moved oversees

- Over time, new investment in pollution intensive industry shows some shift to developing countiries. 



---
# Why the Small Effects?
### &lt;p style="color:#00449E"&gt;  &lt;/p&gt;

- Pollution control costs are a small portion of total business costs


- Costs are only one factor influencing business decisions
  - Factors as diverse as access to markets and the quality of life are important components of business location decisions


- Much pollution control technology is embedded in modern plant designs
  - Chemical plant built in South China will look like one built in West Virginia



---
# Jobs From Environmental Spending
### &lt;p style="color:#00449E"&gt;  &lt;/p&gt;




&lt;img src="lec_figs/gp-fig6-3.png" width="80%" style="display: block; margin: auto;" /&gt;




---
# Green Jobs
### &lt;p style="color:#00449E"&gt;  &lt;/p&gt;

- The bulk of environmental spending is in the private sector, generating a demand for workers, disproportionately  in manufacturing and construction

- This money could have been spent on other things--health care, travel, investment, imported goods--so net job creation could have been higher or lower without environmental regulation



---
# Job Creation?
### &lt;p style="color:#00449E"&gt;  &lt;/p&gt;

- As a rule, money spent on sectors that are both more &lt;u&gt;labor-intensive&lt;/u&gt; and have a &lt;u&gt;higher domestic content&lt;/u&gt; will generate more American jobs in the short run

- Environmental spending is often either labor intensive or has a high domestic content

- If the economy is &lt;u&gt;not at full employment&lt;/u&gt;, or in a locally depressed market, then green spending can lead to more job growth than other types of spending. 




---
# Summary on Jobs
### &lt;p style="color:#00449E"&gt;  &lt;/p&gt;

- In an economy with 150 million workers, new environmental protection rules will neither be a major source of job loss or an engine of green growth. 

  - In select cases, eg, coal, policy needs to help workers who do lose their jobs find new work. 
  
  - These can number in the low thousands per year when new policies are introduced.





---
# General Equilibrium Effects
### &lt;p style="color:#00449E"&gt;  &lt;/p&gt;

- The last important area in which there may be “hidden” costs (or benefits) of regulation lies in what economists call **general equilibrium (GE) effects**---the effects of regulation felt throughout the economy

- General equilibrium effects might raise or lower costs as prices throughout the economy are raised or lowered by regulation, affecting the allocation of labor and capital.




---
# The Double-Dividend Hypothesis
### &lt;p style="color:#00449E"&gt;  &lt;/p&gt;

- A pollution tax can have two beneficial effect on the economy:
  1. Internalizing the externality so that firms and consumers stop over-consuming “dirty” goods.
  2. Benefits from the use of the tax revenue.
  


E.g. Suppose carbon tax revenues were used to cut payroll taxes.
  - Lower taxes on work might cause people to work more hours, raising output. 




---
# The Debate
### &lt;p style="color:#00449E"&gt;  &lt;/p&gt;


- On the other hand: Taxes on pollution lead to higher prices for dirty goods, which means that an hour of work buys fewer goods

- This might make work less attractive, and if people substitute labor for leisure, output falls.

- Economists debate whether these general equilibrium effects lower or raise the net costs of regulation.




---
# Final Look at Benefit-Cost Analysis
### &lt;p style="color:#00449E"&gt; Summary of the EPA’s Estimates of Annualized Benefits, Costs, and Net Benefits of the Final MATS in 2016 (billions of 2007$) &lt;/p&gt;

- Real-world look at a recent EPA benefit-cost analysis for Mercury and Air Toxics Standards (MATS):
  - Regulatory Impact Analysis (RIA) in support of rules that require coal-fired electric utilities to reduce mercury emissions:



&lt;img src="lec_figs/gp-tab6-3.png" width="100%" style="display: block; margin: auto;" /&gt;


---
# Summary of the Costs
### &lt;p style="color:#00449E"&gt;  &lt;/p&gt;

- Total social costs ($9.6 billion) are approximated by the compliance costs

- There are no uncertainty bounds reported for costs

- Analysis does not capture employment shifts or technological innovation

- Industry argues that compliance costs could be 3 times higher




---
# Summary of Benefits
### &lt;p style="color:#00449E"&gt;  &lt;/p&gt;

- The RIA acknowledges huge uncertainty.


- Benefits in the analysis ($37-90 billion) reflect only two benefits:
  - Reductions in cognitive impacts of children exposed to mercury
  - Reductions in sickness and death from “co-benefits” of mercury rules, reductions in tiny particulates (PM2.5) 


- RIA also listed 3 full pages of benefits that the EPA did not try to quantify
