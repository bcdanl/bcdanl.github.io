# Measuring the Costs of Environmental Protection
&lt;html&gt;&lt;div style='float:left'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;hr color='#EB811B' size=1px width=796px&gt;&lt;/html&gt;



---
# The Engineering Approach
### &lt;p style="color:#00449E"&gt;  &lt;/p&gt;

- Engineering approach to measuring costs

  - Add up all the expected expenditures by firms plus state, local, and federal governmental on pollution control and regulatory efforts
  
  - By far the most widespread method in use
  
  - The US EPA periodically administers the Pollution Abatement Costs and Expenditures (PACE) survey, which queries manufacturing plant managers on their capital and operational spending needed to comply with air, land, and water pollution regulations.

  - Require making assumptions about future behavior: technologies adopted, compliance rates, etc.

---
# Opportunity Cost
### &lt;p style="color:#00449E"&gt;  &lt;/p&gt;

- Opportunity cost: The value of resources in their next best available use
  - For example, suppose the new smog laws lead to engineering costs of $2 billion per year. 
  - If as a society we were not devoting this $2 billion to pollution control, would we be able to afford just $2 billion in other goods and services? More? Less? 


- Only opportunity costs measure the true cost of environmental protection


- We will discuss the degree to which engineering cost estimates overstate or understate the “true” costs of environmental protection:
  - Productivity impacts of environmental polices
  - Employment effects of environmental polices
  - General equilibrium effects of environmental polices

---
# Overstatement of True Costs
### &lt;p style="color:#00449E"&gt;  &lt;/p&gt;

- Engineering cost estimates will &lt;u&gt;overstate true social opportunity costs&lt;/u&gt; to the extent that environmental policies:

  - Increase *productivity* by (1) increasing the efficiency with which available resources are used, (2) forcing technological change, or (3) improving worker health or ecosystem services
  
  - Reduce *structural unemployment* by creating “green jobs.”




---
# Understatement of True Costs
### &lt;p style="color:#00449E"&gt;  &lt;/p&gt;

- Engineering cost estimates will &lt;u&gt;understate true social opportunity costs&lt;/u&gt; to the extent that environmental policy:
  
  - Lowers productivity growth by diverting dollars that would have gone into investment
  
  - Induces structural unemployment
  
  - Increases monopoly power in the economy




---
# Productivity Impacts of Regulation
### &lt;p style="color:#00449E"&gt;  &lt;/p&gt;

- The biggest unknown in estimating the costs of environmental protection is its impact on productivity

- Some argue that environmental regulations have been a major contributor to the productivity slowdown

- Others argue that pollution control efforts spur productivity growth by forcing firms to become more efficient




---
# Pro-Productivity Effects of Regulation
### &lt;p style="color:#00449E"&gt;  &lt;/p&gt;

*1*. Improving the short-run efficiency of resource use, saving money for firms


*2*. Encouraging firms to invest more, or invest “smarter” for the long run
  - Porter Hypothesis: regulation, enhances long-run competitiveness
  - Regulation may play a technology-forcing role.


*3*. Reducing health-care costs or improving ecosystem services , which frees up capital for long-run investment




---
# Anti-Productivity Effects of Regulation
### &lt;p style="color:#00449E"&gt;  &lt;/p&gt;

- Regulation imposes direct costs on regulated firms that may crowd out investment in conventional capital

- Slowdown in new investment may occur when regulation is more stringent for new sources of pollution (“grandfathering”)

- Regulation will cause higher prices for important economy-wide inputs, further crowding out investment

- Regulation may frustrate entrepreneurial activity– too much “red tape”




---
# The Cost of Regulation: Productivity Studies
### &lt;p style="color:#00449E"&gt;  &lt;/p&gt;


- Evidence for anti-productivity effects of environmental regulation is not strong.

  - Effects of federal environmental regulations in the 1970s and 1980s account for only a small portion of the total productivity slowdown. 

  - In the absence of regulation, productivity would have fallen anyway due to increased illness and the subsequent diversion of investment resources into the health-care field. 
  
  - A number of studies have supported the Porter hypothesis, finding that firms known for environmental leadership are often more profitable than the average for their industry.



---
# Employment Impacts of Regulation
### &lt;p style="color:#00449E"&gt;  &lt;/p&gt;

- Is job loss a “hidden cost” of environmental protection? 

- Or, is environmental protection the key to  sustainable economic development and “green jobs”?



---
# Employment Impacts of Regulation
### &lt;p style="color:#00449E"&gt; Jobs-Environment Trade-Off? &lt;/p&gt;

- Most of the time, if you hear a sentence that begins with “All economists agree,” you should head for the door

- But in this case, there is an agreement that at the economy-wide level there is simply no such thing as a jobs-environment trade-off




---
# Employment Impacts of Regulation
### &lt;p style="color:#00449E"&gt; Rhetoric around the 1990 Clean Air Act Amendments &lt;/p&gt;

- “A minimum of 200,000 jobs will be quickly lost; this number could easily exceed one or two million”

- It would “move the United States towards the status of a second-class industrial power by the end of the century”

- Actual Job Loss: About 5,000 total spread out over several states, and several years 




---
# Employment Impacts of Regulation
### &lt;p style="color:#00449E"&gt; Economy-wide Effects &lt;/p&gt;

- Regulation does not create long-run unemployment; 
  
  - Instead, it will contribute to a shift in the type of jobs the economy creates: 
  
  - Eg, total solar jobs, which barely existed ten years ago, now exceed total oil and gas jobs and are much greater than total coal jobs.

# Employment Impacts of Regulation
### &lt;p style="color:#00449E"&gt; Economy-wide Effects &lt;/p&gt;


&lt;img src="lec_figs/gp-fig6-2.png" width="45%" style="display: block; margin: auto;" /&gt;




---
# Employment Impacts of Regulation
### &lt;p style="color:#00449E"&gt; What about layoffs from Regulation? &lt;/p&gt;


&lt;img src="lec_figs/gp-tab6-2.png" width="50%" style="display: block; margin: auto;" /&gt;




---
# Employment Impacts of Regulation
### &lt;p style="color:#00449E"&gt; Layoffs Due to Regulation &lt;/p&gt;

- Employer estimates: environmental regulation accounts for less than one tenth of one percent of all mass layoffs nationwide

- 7 plants per year closed primarily as a result of environmental problems

- On average, 2,000-3,000 lost positions each year are due in part to environmental regulation– data consistent year after year. 

- 40 times more layoffs are due to ownership changes than to regulation





---
# Employment Impacts of Regulation
### &lt;p style="color:#00449E"&gt; The Coal Case &lt;/p&gt;


&lt;img src="lec_figs/coal-prod-emp.png" width="85%" style="display: block; margin: auto;" /&gt;

- Technological Change / Competition from Natural Gas &amp; Renewables / Environmental and Climate Regulations



---
# Employment Impacts of Regulation
### &lt;p style="color:#00449E"&gt; The Coal Case &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;img src="lec_figs/coal-prod-emp2.png" width="90%" style="display: block; margin: auto;" /&gt;

---
# Employment Impacts of Regulation
### &lt;p style="color:#00449E"&gt; Pollution Havens? &lt;/p&gt;

- Does pollution intensive industry flee to poor countries with less stringent environmental regulation—”pollution havens“?

- Very few U.S. manufacturing firms have shut down due to environmental regulation, and then moved oversees

- Over time, new investment in pollution intensive industry shows some shift to developing countiries. 



---
# Employment Impacts of Regulation
### &lt;p style="color:#00449E"&gt; Why the Small Effects? &lt;/p&gt;

- Pollution control costs are a small portion of total business costs


- Costs are only one factor influencing business decisions
  - Factors as diverse as access to markets and the quality of life are important components of business location decisions


- Much pollution control technology is embedded in modern plant designs
  - Chemical plant built in South China will look like one built in West Virginia



---
# Employment Impacts of Regulation
### &lt;p style="color:#00449E"&gt; Jobs From Environmental Spending &lt;/p&gt;




&lt;img src="lec_figs/gp-fig6-3.png" width="70%" style="display: block; margin: auto;" /&gt;




---
# Employment Impacts of Regulation
### &lt;p style="color:#00449E"&gt; Green Jobs &lt;/p&gt;

- The bulk of environmental spending is in the private sector, generating a demand for workers, disproportionately  in manufacturing and construction

- This money could have been spent on other things--health care, travel, investment, imported goods--so net job creation could have been higher or lower without environmental regulation



---
# Employment Impacts of Regulation
### &lt;p style="color:#00449E"&gt; Job Creation? &lt;/p&gt;

- As a rule, money spent on sectors that are both more &lt;u&gt;labor-intensive&lt;/u&gt; and have a &lt;u&gt;higher domestic content&lt;/u&gt; will generate more American jobs in the short run

- Environmental spending is often either labor intensive or has a high domestic content

- If the economy is &lt;u&gt;not at full employment&lt;/u&gt;, or in a locally depressed market, then green spending can lead to more job growth than other types of spending. 




---
# Employment Impacts of Regulation
### &lt;p style="color:#00449E"&gt; Summary on Jobs &lt;/p&gt;

- In an economy with 150 million workers, new environmental protection rules will neither be a major source of job loss or an engine of green growth. 

  - In select cases, eg, coal, policy needs to help workers who do lose their jobs find new work. 
  
  - These can number in the low thousands per year when new policies are introduced.






---
# Employment Impacts of Regulation
### &lt;p style="color:#00449E"&gt; Key Lessons Learned About Job Impacts &lt;/p&gt;

1. At the economy-wide level there is no trade-off between jobs and the environment

2. Actual layoffs from environmental protection have been small (about 2,000-3,000 jobs per year)

3. Pollution intensive firms are not fleeing rich countries in large numbers to escape environmental regulation

4. Green Jobs: Environmental Protection spending can boost net job growth when the economy is not at full employment.





---
# General Equilibrium Effects
### &lt;p style="color:#00449E"&gt;  &lt;/p&gt;

- The last important area in which there may be “hidden” costs (or benefits) of regulation lies in what economists call **general equilibrium (GE) effects**---the effects of regulation felt throughout the economy

- General equilibrium effects might raise or lower costs as prices throughout the economy are raised or lowered by regulation, affecting the allocation of labor and capital.




---
# The Double-Dividend Hypothesis
### &lt;p style="color:#00449E"&gt;  &lt;/p&gt;

- A pollution tax can have two beneficial effect on the economy:
  1. Internalizing the externality so that firms and consumers stop over-consuming “dirty” goods.
  2. Benefits from the use of the tax revenue.
  


E.g. Suppose carbon tax revenues were used to cut payroll taxes.
  - Lower taxes on work might cause people to work more hours, raising output. 




---
# The Debate
### &lt;p style="color:#00449E"&gt;  &lt;/p&gt;


- On the other hand: Taxes on pollution lead to higher prices for dirty goods, which means that an hour of work buys fewer goods

- This might make work less attractive, and if people substitute labor for leisure, output falls.

- Economists debate whether these general equilibrium effects lower or raise the net costs of regulation.




---
# Final Look at Benefit-Cost Analysis
### &lt;p style="color:#00449E"&gt; Summary of the EPA’s Estimates of Annualized Benefits, Costs, and Net Benefits of the Final MATS in 2016 (billions of 2007$) &lt;/p&gt;

- Real-world look at a recent EPA benefit-cost analysis for Mercury and Air Toxics Standards (MATS):
  - Regulatory Impact Analysis (RIA) in support of rules that require coal-fired electric utilities to reduce mercury emissions:



&lt;img src="lec_figs/gp-tab6-3.png" width="100%" style="display: block; margin: auto;" /&gt;


---
# Summary of the Costs
### &lt;p style="color:#00449E"&gt;  &lt;/p&gt;

- Total social costs ($9.6 billion) are approximated by the compliance costs

- There are no uncertainty bounds reported for costs

- Analysis does not capture employment shifts or technological innovation

- Industry argues that compliance costs could be 3 times higher




---
# Summary of Benefits
### &lt;p style="color:#00449E"&gt;  &lt;/p&gt;

- The RIA acknowledges huge uncertainty.


- Benefits in the analysis ($37-90 billion) reflect only two benefits:
  - Reductions in cognitive impacts of children exposed to mercury
  - Reductions in sickness and death from “co-benefits” of mercury rules, reductions in tiny particulates (PM2.5) 


- RIA also listed 3 full pages of benefits that the EPA did not try to quantify
