# Impacts of Clean Air Act on Workers' Earnings
### &lt;p style="color:#00449E"&gt;  &lt;/p&gt;


.panelset[
.panel[.panel-name[(1)]

- The reallocative costs of the 1990 Clean Air Act Amendments (CAAA) were significant. 

- Workers in newly regulated plants experienced, in aggregate, more than $9 billion inforegone earnings for the years after the change in policy. 
]


.panel[.panel-name[(2)]
&lt;img src="lec_figs/reed-caaa-foregone-earning.png" width="55%" style="display: block; margin: auto;" /&gt;

]

.panel[.panel-name[(3)]

- Most of these costs are driven by non-employment and lower earnings in future employment, while earnings of workers who remain with their firm change little. 


- Relative to the estimated benefits of the 1990 CAAA, these one-time transitional costs are small. 
  - EPA estimates the benefits of CAAA from 1990-2010 to be between $160 billion and $1 trillion, mostly due to the VSL.
  - However, the estimated costs far exceed the workforce compensation policies designed to mitigate some of these earnings losses.

]

#  General Equilibrium Effects
### &lt;p style="color:#00449E"&gt; The Double-Dividend Hypothesis &lt;/p&gt;

- A pollution tax can have two beneficial effects on the economy:
  - **Environmental dividend**: Internalizing the externality so that firms and consumers stop over-consuming “dirty” goods.
  - **Revenue dividend**: Benefits from the use of the pollution tax revenue.

  
- Economists debate whether these general equilibrium effects lower or raise the net costs of regulation.


---
# Final Look at Benefit-Cost Analysis
### &lt;p style="color:#00449E"&gt;  &lt;/p&gt;

.panelset[

.panel[.panel-name[MATS]

- Real-world look at a recent EPA benefit-cost analysis for Mercury and Air Toxics Standards (MATS):
  - Regulatory Impact Analysis (RIA) in support of rules that require coal-fired electric utilities to reduce mercury emissions:



&lt;img src="lec_figs/gp-tab6-3.png" width="100%" style="display: block; margin: auto;" /&gt;


]
.panel[.panel-name[Costs]

- Total social costs ($9.6 billion) are approximated by the engineering costs


- Analysis does not capture employment shifts, technological innovation, or general equilibrium effects.


- Industry argues that compliance costs could be 3 times higher


- There are no uncertainty bounds reported for costs
  - Hard number illusion: EPA may want to defend the rule from industry attacks
]

.panel[.panel-name[Benefits]
- The RIA acknowledges huge uncertainty.


- Benefits in the analysis ($37-90 billion) reflect only two benefits:
  - Reductions in cognitive impacts of children exposed to mercury
  - Reductions in sickness and death from “co-benefits” of mercury rules, reductions in tiny particulates (PM2.5) 


- RIA also listed 3 full pages of benefits that the EPA did not try to quantify

# The Safety Standard
&lt;html&gt;&lt;div style='float:left'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;hr color='#EB811B' size=1px width=796px&gt;&lt;/html&gt;



---
# Introduction
### &lt;p style="color:#00449E"&gt;  &lt;/p&gt;

&gt; “Your right to swing your arms ends just where the other man's nose begins.”
&gt; `\(-\)` Justice of the U.S. Supreme Court, Oliver Wendell Holmes Jr. describing the **freedom**

--


Many American believe that the freedom to pollute the environment ends where a human body begins.

--


- The safety standard: fairness rather than efficiency 

  - Rejects a benefit-cost approach to decisions about the “correct” amount of pollution
  
  - People have a right to protection from unsolicited, significant harm to their immediate environment


---
# Efficiency vs. Fairness
### &lt;p style="color:#00449E"&gt;  &lt;/p&gt;


.panelset[
.panel[.panel-name[Efficiency Standard]

- Pros: 
  - Can lead to optimal allocation of resources, ensuring that the benefits of a policy outweigh the costs
  - This can be particularly important in contexts where resources are limited


- Cons: 
  - May not adequately protect vulnerable populations
  - The focus on overall utility can sometimes lead to decisions that benefit the majority while harming a minority

]

.panel[.panel-name[Safety Standard]

- Pros: 
  - Prioritizes the protection of health and safety, potentially leading to better outcomes for those at risk. 
  - By putting a large weight on the health of victims, it seeks to prevent harm and protect vulnerable populations.


- Cons: 
  - Can be expensive to implement, potentially leading to inefficient use of resources. 
  - In some cases, the costs of achieving the safety standard could outweigh the benefits, leading to a net loss in social welfare.

# Defining “Safety”
### &lt;p style="color:#00449E"&gt;  &lt;/p&gt;

- In practice, the U.S. EPA considers mortality risk below 1 in 1 million for large populations to be “safe”

- Risks greater than 1 in 10,000 are considered “unsafe”

- Risks that fall in between are regulated based on an informal benefit-cost analysis and statutory requirements

--

- Determining the exact risk amount for things such as cancer can only be done with substantial margins of error.
  - “Safety” is thus often determined on a case-by-case basis through the give and take of politics



---
# Policy and the Safety Standard
### &lt;p style="color:#00449E"&gt;  &lt;/p&gt;

- A safety standard remains the stated goal of much environmental policy: 
  - Laws covering air, water, and land pollution require cleanup to “safe” levels, period





- Ultimately, however, clean-up costs often play a role in the political determination of “safe” pollution levels
  - While U.S. courts do not mention a benefit-cost analysis, they allow costs of attainment to be considered as one factor influencing the stringency of regulation
  - Declare the protection of all individuals from pollution to be a societal right, and then move away from such a goal on a case-by-case basis in the face of rising cost


---
# Can safety be sold?
### &lt;p style="color:#00449E"&gt;  &lt;/p&gt;

- One study asked residents of a Nevada community about their willingness to accept annual tax credits of $1,000, $3,000, and $5,000 per person in exchange for the siting of a potentially dangerous hazardous waste facility nearby

--


- Result: 
  
  - The numbers of people considering accepting the compensation did not increase as the level of compensation increased
  
  - Instead, respondents who perceived the risk to be too high viewed the rebates not as inadequate, but as inappropriate

  - Most of the Nevada sample viewed the risks as inherently noncompensable



---
# The Safety Standard
### &lt;p style="color:#00449E"&gt; Social Welfare Function &lt;/p&gt;

- Recall Tyler and Brittany wrangling over smoking in the office:

$$
`\begin{align}
SW = U_{Tyler}(\#Cigs_{T}, \$_{T}) + U_{Brittany}(\omega \times \#Cigs_{T}, \$_{B})
\end{align}`
$$
- Smoking is a bad to Brittany and a good to Tyler
   
- If the weight given to `\(\omega\)` were large enough, it might justify banning smoking altogether

---
# Smoking in Public Places
### &lt;p style="color:#00449E"&gt;  &lt;/p&gt;

- Should smoking be banned in public places?

- This is an issue for voters and courts to decide

- What the safety standard maintains is that in the absence of a “compelling” argument to the contrary, damage to human health from pollution ought to be minimal

--

- Review: Question 1 in HW 1 vs. Question 1 in Classwork 6 - Mockup Exam

# The Safety Standard: Objections

&lt;/tbody&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;



---
# The Safety Standard: 1. Inefficient
### &lt;p style="color:#00449E"&gt;   &lt;/p&gt;

- The safety standard is, by definition, inefficient

- Efficiency advocates claim that enshrining environmental health as a “right” involves committing “too many” of our overall social resources to environmental protection




---
# The Safety Standard: 1. Inefficient
### &lt;p style="color:#00449E"&gt; Air toxics regulation &lt;/p&gt;

- The 1990 amendments to the Clean Air Act were designed to control the emissions of hazardous air pollutants

- The law required firms to impose control technology that would reduce risks to below the 1 in 10,000 level

- Total costs were estimated at $6 to $10 billion per year, with  benefits less than $4 billion per year


---
# The Safety Standard: 1. Inefficient
### &lt;p style="color:#00449E"&gt; Air toxics regulation &lt;/p&gt;

- Polls indicated that 80% of Americans supported the act despite this benefit-cost disparity
  
  - Does this indicate that American voters view environmental health as a “rights” issue?




---
# The Safety Standard: 1. Inefficient
### &lt;p style="color:#00449E"&gt; Landfill Policy &lt;/p&gt;

- The EPA’s regulation for landfills to protect people who depend on contaminated groundwater were only predicted to reduce cancer cases by only two or three over the next 300 years


- Potential benefits not quantified include
  - Increased ease of siting landfills
  - Reduced damage to surface water
  - Fairness to future generations
  - Overall reduction in waste generation and related “upstream” pollution


- The regulations would cost about $5.8 billion or nearly $2 billion per cancer case reduced




---
# The Safety Standard: 1. Inefficient
### &lt;p style="color:#00449E"&gt; Inefficient Regulations &lt;/p&gt;
- Regulations that protect small groups of people from risk will almost always be inefficient, since even relatively high risks will not generate many casualties

- Air toxics and the EPA’s landfill regulations are classic situations in which efficiency and fairness conflict

- Economists are often efficiency advocates, so one will often find economists leveling normative criticisms at safety-based environmental protection laws.





---
# The Safety Standard: 2. Not Cost Effective?
### &lt;p style="color:#00449E"&gt;  &lt;/p&gt;


- The second criticism leveled at the safety standard is its lack of cost-effectiveness--achieving a goal at the lowest possible cost

- If “safety” is the goal, then extreme measures may be taken to attack “minimal” risk situations instead of high risk situations



---
# The Safety Standard: 2. Not Cost Effective?
### &lt;p style="color:#00449E"&gt; Superfund and Asbestos &lt;/p&gt;


- Tens of millions of dollars have been spent trying to purify seldom used groundwater at toxic spill sites under the Superfund legislation

  - Critics have argued that redirecting the funds would be a better use of resources, for example:
  - Children have about a 5 in 1 million chance of contracting lung cancer from attending a school built with asbestos
  - Redirecting funds from superfund clean-up to asbestos removal could save more lives



---
# The Safety Standard: 2. Not Cost Effective?
### &lt;p style="color:#00449E"&gt; A Safety Proponent’s Response &lt;/p&gt;

- The limits to dealing with these problems are not limited resources, but a lack of political will

- Funds freed up from “overcontrol” in the pollution arena are more likely to be devoted to affluent consumption than to environmental protection




---
# The Safety Standard: 2. Not Cost Effective?
### &lt;p style="color:#00449E"&gt; Risk-Benefit Analysis &lt;/p&gt;

- Authorities use risk-benefit studies to compare the cost-effectiveness of different regulatory options

- The common measure used in this approach is lives saved per dollar spent

- This helps avoid devoting resources to an intractable problem, but it does not mean backing away from safety as a goal




---
# The Safety Standard: 3. Regressive?
### &lt;p style="color:#00449E"&gt;  &lt;/p&gt;
- Safety standards will generally be more restrictive than efficiency standards; as a result, they lead to greater sacrifice of other goods and services

- Some are concerned that a people will fall below a decent standard of living as a result of overregulation

- Suppose we switched from a safety standard to an efficiency-based standard.  Would the poor be made better off?





---
# The Safety Standard: 3. Regressive?
### &lt;p style="color:#00449E"&gt;  &lt;/p&gt;

- Because much pollution is generated in the production of necessities, the cost of environmental regulation is borne unevenly

- Pollution control generally has a regressive impact on income distribution, meaning that, unless compensated for, the higher prices of consumer goods induced by regulation take a bigger percentage bite of the incomes of poor people than of wealthier individuals




---
# The Safety Standard: 3. Regressive?
### &lt;p style="color:#00449E"&gt; Costs of Pollution Control &lt;/p&gt;

- Global warming (CO2) tax of $70 per ton: control:

  - Energy expenses up $215 per year, or 11%  for the poorest 10% of US households

  - Energy expenses up $1,475, or 5% for the richest 10% of US households. 




---
# The Safety Standard: 3. Regressive?
### &lt;p style="color:#00449E"&gt; Progressive benefits from pollution control? &lt;/p&gt;

- Poor people tend to live in more polluted areas, and so benefit more from clean-up (or are harmed more when standards are relaxed). 
  - Several research on the Housing Market and the Superfund Program find that residents of areas near hazardous waste sites are more likely to be poor and have lower levels of education than others.
--

  - E.g., 2015 Water Crisis in Flint, MI, home to 25 superfund sites
  - In January 2015 the city informed residents that elevated levels of carcinogenic trihalomethanes had been detected in Flint's water but insisted that it remained safe to drink. 
  - Later that month, dangerous levels of lead were detected in two water fountains on the University of Michigan–Flint campus.
  
  




---
# The Safety Standard: 3. Regressive?
### &lt;p style="color:#00449E"&gt; Environmental Racism &lt;/p&gt;

- Racial inequity in exposure to pollution (e.g., in Flint, MI) is called environmental racism

- Environmental racism has sparked a political movement called the environmental justice movement




---
# The Safety Standard: 3. Regressive?
### &lt;p style="color:#00449E"&gt; Is exposure due to low income or race? &lt;/p&gt;


&lt;img src="lec_figs/gp-tab7-1.png" width="55%" style="display: block; margin: auto;" /&gt;




---
# The Safety Standard: 3. Regressive?
### &lt;p style="color:#00449E"&gt; The Overall Effect of Pollution Control on Low Income Communities &lt;/p&gt;


- Poor, working-class, and minority people pay more, relative to their income, for pollution control. They also receive more benefits.

- Hard to determine whether pollution control results in net benefits or net costs on the lower half of the income distribution.

- For important issues such as a carbon tax to slow global warming, distributional issues need to be weighed carefully.
