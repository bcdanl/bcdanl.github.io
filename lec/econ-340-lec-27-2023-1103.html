# The Safety Standard
&lt;html&gt;&lt;div style='float:left'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;hr color='#EB811B' size=1px width=796px&gt;&lt;/html&gt;


---
# The Safety Standard: 1. Inefficient
### &lt;p style="color:#00449E"&gt; Inefficient Regulations  &lt;/p&gt;

- The safety standard is, by definition, inefficient

- Efficiency advocates claim that enshrining environmental health as a “right” involves committing “too many” of our overall social resources to environmental protection

--

- Regulations that protect small groups of people from risk will almost always be inefficient, since even relatively high risks will not generate many casualties

- Air toxics and the EPA’s landfill regulations are classic situations in which efficiency and fairness conflict



---
# The Safety Standard: 2. Not Cost Effective?
### &lt;p style="color:#00449E"&gt;  &lt;/p&gt;


- The second criticism leveled at the safety standard is its lack of cost-effectiveness--achieving a goal at the lowest possible cost

- The cost-effectiveness criticism is not that safety is a bad goal per se, but that it gives no guidance to ensure that the maximum amount of safety is indeed purchased with the available resources.

--

- Authorities use risk-benefit studies to compare the cost-effectiveness of different regulatory options

  - The common measure used in this approach is lives saved per dollar spent


---
# The Safety Standard: 3. Regressive?
### &lt;p style="color:#00449E"&gt;  &lt;/p&gt;

- Because much pollution is generated in the production of necessities, the cost of environmental regulation is borne unevenly

- Pollution control generally has a regressive impact on income distribution. 
  - Unless compensated for, the higher prices of consumer goods induced by regulation take a bigger percentage bite of the incomes of poor people than of wealthier individuals




---
# The Safety Standard: 3. Regressive?
### &lt;p style="color:#00449E"&gt; Costs of Pollution Control &lt;/p&gt;

- Global warming (CO2) tax of $70 per ton: 

  - Energy expenses up $215 per year, or **11%**  for the poorest 10% of US households

  - Energy expenses up $1,475, or **5%** for the richest 10% of US households. 




---
# The Safety Standard: 3. Regressive?
### &lt;p style="color:#00449E"&gt; Progressive benefits from pollution control? &lt;/p&gt;

- Poor people tend to live in more polluted areas, and so benefit more from clean-up (or are harmed more when standards are relaxed). 

  - Residents of areas near hazardous waste sites are more likely to be poor and have lower levels of education than others.

  - E.g., 2015 Water Crisis in Flint, MI
  


---
# The Safety Standard: 3. Regressive?
### &lt;p style="color:#00449E"&gt; Environmental Racism &lt;/p&gt;

- Racial inequity in exposure to pollution (e.g., in Flint, MI) is called environmental racism

- Environmental racism has sparked a political movement called the environmental justice movement, demanding stronger enforcement of safety-based laws.




---
# The Safety Standard: 3. Regressive?
### &lt;p style="color:#00449E"&gt; Is exposure due to low income or race? &lt;/p&gt;


&lt;img src="lec_figs/gp-tab7-1.png" width="95%" style="display: block; margin: auto;" /&gt;

- Do polluting industries locate in poor and minority communities, taking advantage of less effective political resistance and/or cheaper land? 

- Or do low-income people choose to locate close to hazardous facilities because rents are cheaper there?


---
# The Safety Standard: 3. Regressive?
### &lt;p style="color:#00449E"&gt; The Overall Effect of Pollution Control on Low Income Communities &lt;/p&gt;


- Poor, working-class, and minority people pay more, relative to their income, for pollution control. They also receive more benefits.

- Hard to determine whether pollution control results in net benefits or net costs on the lower half of the income distribution.

- For important issues such as a carbon tax to slow climate change, distributional issues need to be weighed carefully.



---
# Safety versus Efficiency
### &lt;p style="color:#00449E"&gt; The Summers Memo &lt;/p&gt;

- In an internal memorandum to his staff, then chief economist at the World Bank, Lawrence Summers wrote:  

&gt; “Just between you and me, shouldn’t the World Bank be encouraging more migration of the dirty industries to the [less-developed countries]? ... I think the economic logic behind dumping a load of waste in the lowest-wage country is impeccable and we should face up to that.”

--

- We have defined this “narrow” view as the efficiency view. 
  - Is it is morally defensible? 

- Possibly, if toxic trade in fact makes all parties better off…

# Global plastics trade hits record $1.2 trillion
### &lt;p style="color:#00449E"&gt;  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;img src="lec_figs/plastic-trade-unctad.png" width="100%" style="display: block; margin: auto;" /&gt;

# Global plastics trade hits record $1.2 trillion
### &lt;p style="color:#00449E"&gt;  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;img src="lec_figs/plastic-trade-basel-action-network.jpeg" width="95%" style="display: block; margin: auto;" /&gt;


---
# Siting Hazardous Waste Facilities
### &lt;p style="color:#00449E"&gt; Safety Versus Efficiency &lt;/p&gt;

- “**Locally unwanted land uses**” or **LULU**s refer to sites for the disposal of waste--hazardous, radioactive, or just non-hazardous municipal waste

- LULUs impose negative externalities on their neighbors from potential hazards of exposure to decreased land values

- By definition, communities do not want LULUs, and the wealthier the community, the higher the level of safety the community will demand


---
# Compensation for LULUs
### &lt;p style="color:#00449E"&gt; &lt;/p&gt;

- Society as a whole benefits greatly from having toxic facilities

- One solution to the problem of LULUs would then be to monetarily compensate communities with LULUs

- This compensation could then pay for schools, hospitals, libraries, etc.

- Poorer communities would accept lower compensation levels than wealthier communities

- This could lead to a “trade” in LULUs


---
# Efficiency and Toxic Trade
### &lt;p style="color:#00449E"&gt; &lt;/p&gt;

.panelset[
.panel[.panel-name[(1)]


&lt;img src="lec_figs/gp-fig7-1.png" width="60%" style="display: block; margin: auto;" /&gt;

]

.panel[.panel-name[(2)]

- Due to lower incomes, a poor country has a marginal benefit of cleanup schedule lying below that of a rich country

- Because current pollution levels are relatively low in the poor country, the marginal benefits of cleanup are also low relative to a rich country

- Transferring 10% of the waste from a rich country to a poor country reduces monetary damages in the rich country more than it increases damages in the poor country

- The poor country would then be compensated for its damages and overall monetary damages from the pollution will have been reduced by trade
]

]

---
# Winners and Losers
### &lt;p style="color:#00449E"&gt; &lt;/p&gt;

- Winners: 
  - Those in wealthy countries no longer exposed to waste
  - Those around the world who can buy cheaper products
  - Firm managers and stock holders, 
  - Those in poor countries working at dump sites


- Losers: 
  - Poor country individuals, alive and yet unborn, who contract cancer and other diseases
  - Those who rely on natural resources that may be damaged in the transport and disposal process


---
# Everybody Wins?
### &lt;p style="color:#00449E"&gt; &lt;/p&gt;

- Because dumping toxics is indeed efficient, the total monetary gains to the winners outweigh the total monetary loss to the losers

- In theory, the winners could compensate the losers, and everyone would be made better off

- In practice, complete compensation is unlikely



---
# Problems With Toxic Trade
### &lt;p style="color:#00449E"&gt; &lt;/p&gt;

- The majority of benefits from the dumping will flow to the relatively wealthy while the poor will bear the burden of costs


- The political structure in many developing countries is far from democratic, and highly susceptible to corruption


- Few poor countries have the resources for effective regulation


- Stiff regulation or high taxes will increase the rate of illegal dumping; 
  -  Countries with lower environmental standards may receive an influx of foreign waste
  - Unrestricted trade in waste may thus lower the welfare of the recipient country



---
# Safety Standard and the Siting of LULUs
### &lt;p style="color:#00449E"&gt; &lt;/p&gt;

- A politically acceptable definition of “safety” cannot be worked out, since a small group bears the burden of any risk: 
  - Nobody wants a LULU in his or her backyard


- Compensation thus plays role in the siting of hazardous facilities


- Firms and governments will seek out poorer communities with less political power and thus lower compensation packages


---
# For the Benefit of a Majority
### &lt;p style="color:#00449E"&gt; &lt;/p&gt;

- To ensure a majority of people benefit from the siting of LULUs:

  1. Government must be capable of providing effective regulation

  2. An open political process combined with well-informed, democratic decision making is needed in the siting process


- Without these conditions, the siting of LULUs could exploit vulnerable communities rather than provide them with fair compensation and safety guarantees.

---
# Safety Versus Efficiency
### &lt;p style="color:#00449E"&gt; &lt;/p&gt;

- The safety standard relies on a liberty argument, putting heavy weights on the welfare reduction from pollution

- As a result, a stricter pollution standard is called for than is implied by the efficiency standard

- Efficiency advocates attack the “fairness” argument of safety advocates by arguing that the safety standard is regressive--although this is difficult to prove or refute in general


---
# Safety Versus Efficiency
### &lt;p style="color:#00449E"&gt;  &lt;/p&gt;


.panelset[
.panel[.panel-name[Efficiency Standard]

- Pros: 
  - Can lead to optimal allocation of resources, ensuring that the benefits of a policy outweigh the costs
  - This can be particularly important in contexts where resources are limited


- Cons: 
  - May not adequately protect vulnerable populations
  - The focus on overall utility can sometimes lead to decisions that benefit the majority while harming a minority

]

.panel[.panel-name[Safety Standard]

- Pros: 
  - Prioritizes the protection of health and safety, potentially leading to better outcomes for those at risk. 
  - By putting a large weight on the health of victims, it seeks to prevent harm and protect vulnerable populations.


- Cons: 
  - Can be expensive to implement, potentially leading to inefficient use of resources. 
  - Often cost-ineffective.
  - May be regressive.

# Costs, Benefits, Efficiency, and Safety
### &lt;p style="color:#00449E"&gt; &lt;/p&gt;


&lt;img src="lec_figs/gp-fig7-2.png" width="80%" style="display: block; margin: auto;" /&gt;


---
# Safety Versus Efficiency
### &lt;p style="color:#00449E"&gt;  &lt;/p&gt;

- The real trade-off is between increased material consumption and increased environmental quality.
  - What real benefits would we gain from the increased consumption that is sacrificed by tighter environmental controls? 


- If benefit estimates leave out much that is hard to quantify, then safety may be “more efficient” than efficiency!

---
# Introduction 
### &lt;p style="color:#00449E"&gt; &lt;/p&gt;

.panelset[
.panel[.panel-name[(1)]

- Now, we move beyond our efficiency versus safety debate over pollution-control standards to consider long-run impacts

- A **stock** pollutant is a pollutant that has long-term consequences.

- In contrast, **flow** pollutants do their damage relatively quickly and are then either diluted to harmless levels or transformed into harmless substances

]
.panel[.panel-name[(2)]
- People modify the environment in two ways: through the use of **natural resources** and the exhaustion of **environmental sinks**.
  - Resources and sinks can be renewable or non-renewable.

- As long as the rate of extraction of renewable resource stocks is balanced by regeneration, resource use will not reduce future availability. However, any use of nonrenewable resources reduces their stock.

]

]

---
# Big Question
### &lt;p style="color:#00449E"&gt; &lt;/p&gt;

- How can we ensure that we leave future generations a sufficient stock of renewable and non-renewable resources and pollution sinks (natural capital) to insure their well-being?

- In other words, how can we ensure our use of natural capital is “sustainable”?
