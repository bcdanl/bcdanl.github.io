# The Safety Standard
&lt;html&gt;&lt;div style='float:left'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;hr color='#EB811B' size=1px width=796px&gt;&lt;/html&gt;


---
# Safety versus Efficiency
### &lt;p style="color:#00449E"&gt; The Summers Memo &lt;/p&gt;

- In an internal memorandum to his staff, then chief economist at the World Bank, Lawrence Summers wrote:  

&gt; “Just between you and me, shouldn’t the World Bank be encouraging more migration of the dirty industries to the [less-developed countries]? ... I think the economic logic behind dumping a load of waste in the lowest-wage country is impeccable and we should face up to that.”

--

- We have defined this “narrow” view as the efficiency view. 
  - Is it is morally defensible? 

- Possibly, if toxic trade in fact makes all parties better off…


---
# Siting Hazardous Waste Facilities
### &lt;p style="color:#00449E"&gt; Safety Versus Efficiency &lt;/p&gt;

- “**Locally unwanted land uses**” or **LULU**s refer to sites for the disposal of waste--hazardous, radioactive, or just non-hazardous municipal waste

- LULUs impose negative externalities on their neighbors from potential hazards of exposure to decreased land values

- By definition, communities do not want LULUs, and the wealthier the community, the higher the level of safety the community will demand


---
# Compensation for LULUs
### &lt;p style="color:#00449E"&gt; &lt;/p&gt;

- Society as a whole benefits greatly from having toxic facilities

- One solution to the problem of LULUs would then be to monetarily compensate communities with LULUs

  - This compensation could then pay for schools, hospitals, libraries, etc.

  - Poorer communities would accept lower compensation levels than wealthier communities

- This could lead to a “trade” in LULUs


---
# Winners and Losers from Global Toxic Trade
### &lt;p style="color:#00449E"&gt; &lt;/p&gt;

- Winners: 
  - Those in wealthy countries no longer exposed to waste
  - Those around the world who can buy cheaper products
  - Firm managers and stock holders
  - Those in poor countries working at dump sites


- Losers: 
  - Poor country individuals, alive and yet unborn, who contract cancer and other diseases
  - Those who rely on natural resources that may be damaged in the transport and disposal process


---
# Everybody Wins?
### &lt;p style="color:#00449E"&gt; &lt;/p&gt;

- Because dumping toxics is indeed efficient, the total monetary gains to the winners outweigh the total monetary loss to the losers

- In theory, the winners could compensate the losers, and everyone would be made better off

- In practice, complete compensation is unlikely




---
# For the Benefit of a Majority
### &lt;p style="color:#00449E"&gt; &lt;/p&gt;


- To ensure a majority of people benefit from the siting of LULUs:

  1. Government must be capable of providing effective regulation

  2. An open political process combined with well-informed, democratic decision making is needed in the siting process


- Without these conditions, the siting of LULUs could exploit vulnerable communities rather than provide them with fair compensation and safety guarantees.


---
# Safety Versus Efficiency
### &lt;p style="color:#00449E"&gt; &lt;/p&gt;

- The safety standard relies on a liberty argument, putting heavy weights on the welfare reduction from pollution

- As a result, a stricter pollution standard is called for than is implied by the efficiency standard

- Efficiency advocates attack the “fairness” argument of safety advocates by arguing that the safety standard is regressive--although this is difficult to prove or refute in general


---
# Safety Versus Efficiency
### &lt;p style="color:#00449E"&gt;  &lt;/p&gt;


.panelset[
.panel[.panel-name[Efficiency Standard]

- Pros: 
  - Can lead to optimal allocation of resources, ensuring that the benefits of a policy outweigh the costs
  - This can be particularly important in contexts where resources are limited


- Cons: 
  - May not adequately protect vulnerable populations
  - The focus on overall utility can sometimes lead to decisions that benefit the majority while harming a minority

]

.panel[.panel-name[Safety Standard]

- Pros: 
  - Prioritizes the protection of health and safety, potentially leading to better outcomes for those at risk. 
  - By putting a large weight on the health of victims, it seeks to prevent harm and protect vulnerable populations.


- Cons: 
  - Can be expensive to implement, potentially leading to inefficient use of resources. 
  - Often cost-ineffective.
  - May be regressive.

# Costs, Benefits, Efficiency, and Safety
### &lt;p style="color:#00449E"&gt; &lt;/p&gt;

# Safety Versus Efficiency
### &lt;p style="color:#00449E"&gt;  &lt;/p&gt;

- The real trade-off is between increased material consumption and increased environmental quality.
  - What real benefits would we gain from the increased consumption that is sacrificed by tighter environmental controls? 


- If benefit estimates leave out much that is hard to quantify, then safety may be “more efficient” than efficiency.

# Introduction 
### &lt;p style="color:#00449E"&gt; &lt;/p&gt;

.panelset[
.panel[.panel-name[(1)]

.pull-left[
&lt;!-- - Now, we move beyond our efficiency versus safety debate over pollution-control standards to consider long-run impacts --&gt;

- A **stock** pollutant is a pollutant that has long-term consequences.

- A **flow** pollutant does their damage relatively quickly and are then either diluted to harmless levels or transformed into harmless substances
]

.pull-right[
&lt;img src="lec_figs/stock-flow-co2.jpg" width="100%" style="display: block; margin: auto;" /&gt;
]

]


.panel[.panel-name[(2)]
- People modify the environment in two ways: through the use of **natural resources** and the exhaustion of **environmental sinks**.
  - Resources and sinks can be *renewable* or *non-renewable*.
  - Renewables: solar, wind, hydropower, fishes, forest, etc.
  - Non-renewables: fossil fuel, metals, rare earth materials, etc.


- As long as the rate of extraction of renewable resource stocks is balanced by regeneration, resource use will not reduce future availability. 
  - However, any use of nonrenewable resources reduces their stock.

]

]

---
# Big Question on Sustainability
### &lt;p style="color:#00449E"&gt; &lt;/p&gt;

- How should we incorporate the interests of future generations into environmental protection measures taken today?

- How can we ensure that we leave future generations a sufficient stock of renewable and non-renewable resources and pollution sinks (natural capital) to insure their well-being?

- In other words, how can we ensure our use of natural capital is “sustainable”?



---
# Weak and Strong Sustainability
### &lt;p style="color:#00449E"&gt; &lt;/p&gt;


.panelset[
.panel[.panel-name[Sustainability]
- Common definition of **sustainable** development:

&gt; “development that meets the needs of the present without compromising the ability of future generations to meet their own needs” (World Commission on Environment and Development (1987)


- In economics, 
  - A sustainable economy is one in which the well-being of a typical member of all future generations will be higher, or at least the same, as the well-being of the typical member of the current generation
]

.panel[.panel-name[Weak sustainability]
- Requires that the *overall* capital stock needed to support a high quality of life — including (1) **manufactured**, (2) **human**, (3) **social**, and (4) **natural** capital—is maintained


- In other words, *weak sustainability* can be achieved even with the loss of natural capital as long as other forms of capital are adequate substitutes


- It may also be possible to substitute in consumption, if increased consumption of one good replaces the loss of another and keeps people equally satisfied.
  - If we give future generations more material goods but more pollution and fewer natural capital, will they think that is a good trade?

]

.panel[.panel-name[Strong sustainability]
- Requires maintaining the total stock of each form of capital separately (natural, manufactured, human, and social)


- Focuses on measures of natural capital


- Emphasize irreplaceable assets, those things for which there is no substitute
  - If all plants went extinct people would soon follow.

]

# Neoclassical vs. Econological Economists
### &lt;p style="color:#00449E"&gt; &lt;/p&gt;


.panelset[
.panel[.panel-name[Neoclassical]
- Discussions around weak and strong sustainability have divided economists into two broad groups: *neoclassical* and *ecological*.
  - In reality, many economists have one foot in both camps.
  
  
- Neoclassical economists view natural and other forms of capital generally as substitutes in production
  - View nature as highly resilient


- Globalization, if it promotes development, can also lead to a sustainable future


- Sustainability is achieved through a well-functioning and properly regulated market system

]

.panel[.panel-name[Ecological]

- Ecological economists argue that other forms of capital cannot generally be used to substitute for natural capital

- The global ecosystems in which our economy is embedded are fragile

- Tend to be technological pessimists

- See the need for an expanded role for government in aggressively protecting our dwindling stock of natural capital.

]

]


---
# Implementing weak sustainability: 
### &lt;p style="color:#00449E"&gt; Use Benefit-cost and Discounting &lt;/p&gt;

- Weak sustainability assumes that it is generally possible to substitute human made for natural capital. 
  - But natural capital produces goods and services over long periods of time. 


- How do we value the services of natural capital (e.g., climate regulation, fresh water filtering, biodiversity preservation) far into the future?

--

- The answer: use benefit-cost analysis to assess if it is more efficient to protect or to use up the natural capital today. 
  - But how do we value the dollar value of, say the water purification services of a wetland, over decades?




---
# Discounting
### &lt;p style="color:#00449E"&gt;  &lt;/p&gt;


.panelset[
.panel[.panel-name[(1)]

**Q**. Imagine you have the choice between receiving $10,000 in real purchasing power this year or next year. Which option would you choose?


- Suppose you choose to receive $10,000 and make a deposit on a savings account with the 3% interest rate.


- You will have $10,300 to spend in the next year.
  - Where does the bank get the extra $300?
  
]


.panel[.panel-name[(2)]
- The bank loans out the savings to firms and the government who in trun invests it in productive real assets: machines, buildings, roads, and schools.


- A year later, thanks to your saving effort, and other people’s ingenuity and labor, the economy as a whole is capable of producing 300 more dollars worth of stuff


- At the national level, this year-to-year increase in productive capacity leads GDP to grow on average around 2 to 3% per year. 
  - This growth is the ultimate source of profits, interest, and wage increases.

]

.panel[.panel-name[(3)]

- Investment is productive.
  - From an individual’s point of view, $10,000 today is worth more than $10,000 next year.
  - From a social point of view, resources today are worth more than same resources in the future because resources today can be invested to yield more resources in the future.
  
  
- We often translate the future value into the present value by applying a discount rate on future values.
  - We can think of the **discount rate** as the rate of return on capital investments.

]


]

# Future Benefits, Costs, and Discounting
### &lt;p style="color:#00449E"&gt; &lt;/p&gt;


.panelset[
.panel[.panel-name[(1)]
- How does discounting relate to the environment? 

- Suppose a decision today to clean up a hazardous waste site costing taxpayers $1.3 million. 

- If we fail to clean up, then in the year 2063, Joanne who lived close to the site will contract a nonfatal cancer, thus imposing costs on Joanne to $1.5 million.

**Q**. Should we spend $1.3 million this year to prevent $1.5 million in damages in 40 years’ time?

]

.panel[.panel-name[(2)]

- An efficiency advocate would argue no. 


- We could more than compensate the future pollution victim for the damage done by setting aside money today that would be available for Joanne’s health care and compensatory damage payments in 40 years. 


- We could put a much smaller amount of money in the bank today, and by earning interest, it would grow over time to equal $1.5 million. 
  - In fact, $1.5 million in 2063 is equivalent to only $459,800 banked today (2023) at a 3% real (inflation-adjusted) rate of interest. 




]


.panel[.panel-name[(3)]

- Putting money aside into a bank account specifically to compensate future generations for pollution damages or depletion of natural capital is known as posting an **environmental bond**

- The potential for posting an environmental bond offers us a rationale for spending less on prevention today than the full value of the damage we inflict on future generations.

- When future benefits are not weighted as heavily as current benefits, we say that the future benefits have been **discounted**.

# Discounting formula
### &lt;p style="color:#00449E"&gt; &lt;/p&gt;

- The *present discounted value* (**PDV**) of $X received in T years is the amount of money one would need to invest today to receive $X in T years, at a specified rate of interest, or **discount rate**, r

$$PDV = \frac{\text{\$}X}{(1+r)^{T}}$$
- The discount rate refers to the rate at which future values are decreased to find an equivalent present value. 

- The funds used to purchase Manhattan Island for $24 in 1626!
  - When invested at a 4.65 percent real interest rate, it would bring you the entire immense value of land in Manhattan today.




---
# Discounting Example: Lightbulbs
### &lt;p style="color:#00449E"&gt; &lt;/p&gt;


.panelset[
.panel[.panel-name[(1)]
- Hotel needs a 1,000 new light bulbs

- LED costs $40,000 to buy up front and $500 each year for electricity

- Incandescent costs $10,000 each year to buy and $3,000 for electricity

&lt;img src="lec_figs/gp-tab8-1.png" width="85%" style="display: block; margin: auto;" /&gt;

]

.panel[.panel-name[(2)]
- Go with LED’s? It’s not that simple…

- We must calculate the present discounted value 

- The PDV will tell you how much, in today’s dollars, investment in LED bulbs saves over incandescent bulbs

`$$PDV = -\frac{27,500}{(1 + r)^{0}} + \frac{12,500}{(1 + r)^{1}} + \frac{12,500}{(1 + r)^{2}}  + \frac{12,500}{(1 + r)^{3}}$$`

- So which is better, LED or incandescent? 

- It depends on the discount rate

# Savings, Investment, and Market Interest Rates
### &lt;p style="color:#00449E"&gt; &lt;/p&gt;

- What determines an interest rate or market discount rate? Supply &amp; Demand in the **market for “loanable funds”**

- The supply of loanable funds is determined by bank deposits—money in individual and business savings accounts that, in turn, form the basis for loans by banks

- The U.S. savings rate is typically 5% or less. 
  - Why so low? 
  - One reason: **A positive rate of time preference**: the well-known desire to consume more today, regardless of the consequences for tomorrow.




---
# Market for Loanable Funds
### &lt;p style="color:#00449E"&gt; &lt;/p&gt;

- On the other side of the market, **the demand curve for loanable funds** reflects the opportunities for productive investment projects in the economy

- Both the quantity of loans supplied and demanded depend on the interest rate: Higher rates lead to a desire for more savings, and less desire for borrowing.  

- At the same time, reductions in the overall supply of loanable funds, or an increase in demand, will raise market rates and lead to greater discounting of the future. 




---
# S slope’s up, D Down: Why?
### &lt;p style="color:#00449E"&gt; Interest Rate Determination in the Market for Loanable Funds &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;img src="lec_figs/gp-fig8-1.png" width="65%" style="display: block; margin: auto;" /&gt;




---
# Discounting &amp; Benefit-Cost
### &lt;p style="color:#00449E"&gt; &lt;/p&gt;

- For private managers seeking to maximize profits, use the risk-adjusted rate of interest.

- For economists using benefit-cost analysis trying to decide what is efficient for society: what discount rate to choose????

- It matters, a lot, for decisions where costs are more than 20 years out. 




---
# Discounting Climate Change
### &lt;p style="color:#00449E"&gt; &lt;/p&gt;

- With long time periods (ie. Climate change), the choice of discount rate becomes extremely important


&lt;img src="lec_figs/gp-tab8-3.png" width="65%" style="display: block; margin: auto;" /&gt;




---
# The Social Discount Rate and Dynamic Efficiency
### &lt;p style="color:#00449E"&gt; &lt;/p&gt;

- At what rate should society be compensated in the future for giving up a unit of consumption today such that overall well-being is preserved?

- The Ramsey equation:

`$$r = \delta + \eta g$$`

- `\(\delta\,\)`: the rate of time preference
- `\(g\,\)`: the growth rate of consumption in the economy
- `\(\eta\,\)`: the elasticity of the marginal utility of consumption
  - In other words, the utility value of extra income as a society grows richer


$$
`\begin{align}
r &amp;= \delta + \eta g\\
&amp;= 1\% + 2 * 2\%= 5\%
\end{align}`
$$


---
# Discounting Climate Change
### &lt;p style="color:#00449E"&gt; &lt;/p&gt;

- Recall Nicholas Stern’s projections from chapter 1 that we must cut 80% of CO2 by 2050. 
  - He assumes a low  1.4% discount rate, so that future damages play a big role in the analysis. 


$$
`\begin{align}
r &amp;= \delta + \eta g\\
&amp;= 0.1\% + 1 * 1.3\%\\
&amp;= 1.4\%
\end{align}`
$$

- William Nordhaus called for allowing global emissions to grow by 40%. 
  - His analysis was based on 5.5% discount rate, in which future damages get discounted close to zero.





---
# Strong Sustainability
### &lt;p style="color:#00449E"&gt; &lt;/p&gt;

- **Precautionary Principle**: Never reduce the stock of natural capital below a level that generates a sustained yield of services unless good substitutes are currently available for the services generated. 
  - When in doubt, conserve

- To determine the availability of substitutes requires focusing on **uniqueness** and **uncertainty** combined with **irreversibility**




---
# Strong Sustainability in Practice
### &lt;p style="color:#00449E"&gt; &lt;/p&gt;

- The **Endangered Species Act** is the only piece of U.S. legislation that requires strong sustainability


- **National Environmental Policy Act** (**NEPA**), requires a “light” version of the precautionary principle
  - Requires **environmental impact statement** (**EIS**) for “legislation or other major federal actions significantly affecting the quality of the human environment.”


- In the EU, **REACH** (**registration, evaluation, and authorization of chemicals**) requires chemical manufacturers to carry out health and environmental safety tests prior to introducing new chemicals
