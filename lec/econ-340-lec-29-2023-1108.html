### &lt;p style="color:#00449E"&gt; &lt;/p&gt;

.pull-left[
- A **stock** pollutant is a pollutant that has long-term consequences.

- A **flow** pollutant does their damage relatively quickly and are then either diluted to harmless levels or transformed into harmless substances.

# Big Question on Sustainability
### &lt;p style="color:#00449E"&gt; &lt;/p&gt;

- Climate change is a long-term problem.
  - If we do not care about the distant future, then climate change is of little concern.


--

- How should we incorporate the interests of future generations into environmental protection measures taken today?


--

- How can we ensure that we leave future generations a sufficient stock of natural capital to insure their well-being?
  - In other words, how can we ensure our use of natural capital is “**sustainable**”?



---
# Weak and Strong Sustainability
### &lt;p style="color:#00449E"&gt; &lt;/p&gt;


.panelset[
.panel[.panel-name[Sustainability]
- Common definition of **sustainable** development:

&gt; “development that meets the needs of the present without compromising the ability of future generations to meet their own needs” (World Commission on Environment and Development (1987)


- In economics, 
  - A **sustainable** economy is one in which the well-being of a typical member of all future generations will be higher, or at least the same, as the well-being of the typical member of the current generation

]

.panel[.panel-name[Weak sustainability]
- Requires that the *overall* capital stock needed to support a high quality of life — including (1) **manufactured**, (2) **human**, (3) **social**, and (4) **natural** capital—is maintained

- In other words, *weak sustainability* can be achieved even with the loss of natural capital as long as other forms of capital are adequate substitutes


- It may also be possible to substitute in consumption, if increased consumption of one good replaces the loss of another and keeps people equally satisfied.
  - If we give future generations more material goods but more pollution and fewer natural capital, will they think that is a good trade?

]

.panel[.panel-name[Strong sustainability]
- Requires maintaining the total stock of each form of capital separately (natural, manufactured, human, and social)


- Focuses on measures of natural capital


- Emphasize irreplaceable assets, those things for which there is no substitute
  - If all plants went extinct people would soon follow.

# Benefit-Cost Analysis with Discounting
### &lt;p style="color:#00449E"&gt;  &lt;/p&gt;


- **Q**. How do we value benefits reaped by future generations that result from environmental production today (e.g., climate regulation, fresh water filtering, biodiversity preservation)?


--


- **A**. We can use benefit-cost analysis to assess if it is more efficient to protect or to use up the natural capital today. 
  - But how do we value the dollar value of, say the water purification services of a wetland, **over decades**?



---
# Why Discounting?
### &lt;p style="color:#00449E"&gt; Investment is productive &lt;/p&gt;


.panelset[
.panel[.panel-name[$10k Now or Later?]

**Q**. Imagine you have the choice between receiving $10,000 in real purchasing power this year or next year. 


- Suppose you choose to receive $10,000 and make a deposit on a savings account with the 3% interest rate.


- You will have $10,300 to spend in the next year.
  - Where does the bank get the extra $300?
  
]


.panel[.panel-name[Savings, Loans, &amp; Investment]
- The bank loans out the savings to firms and the government.
  - They in turn *invests* it in productive real assets: machines, buildings, roads, and schools.


- A year later, the economy as a whole is capable of producing more than $300 worth of stuff


- At the national level, this year-to-year increase in productive capacity leads GDP to grow on average around 2 to 3% per year. 
  - This growth is the ultimate source of profits, interest, and wage increases.

]

.panel[.panel-name[Discount Rate]

- *Investment is productive*.
  - From a social point of view, resources today are worth more than same resources in the future.
  - This is because resources today can be invested to yield more resources in the future.
  
  
- We often translate the future value into the present value by applying a **discount rate** on future values.
  - We can think of the **discount rate** as the rate of return on capital investments.

]

# Discounting and the Environment
### &lt;p style="color:#00449E"&gt;  &lt;/p&gt;


.panelset[
.panel[.panel-name[Question]
- Suppose a decision today to clean up a hazardous waste site costing taxpayers $1.3 million.

- If we fail to clean up, then in the year 2063, Joanne who lived close to the site will contract a nonfatal cancer, thus imposing costs on Joanne to $1.5 million.

- **Q**. Should we spend $1.3 million this year to prevent $1.5 million in damages in 40 years’ time?

]

.panel[.panel-name[Answer]

- An efficiency advocate would argue no. 


- We could more than compensate the future pollution victim for the damage done by setting aside money today that would be available for Joanne’s health care and compensatory damage payments in 40 years. 


- We could put a much smaller amount of money in the bank today, and by earning interest, it would grow over time to equal $1.5 million. 
  - In fact, $1.5 million in 2063 is equivalent to only $459,800 banked today (2023) at a 3% real (inflation-adjusted) rate of interest.

# Discounting Formula
### &lt;p style="color:#00449E"&gt; &lt;/p&gt;

- The *present discounted value* (**PDV**) of $X received in `\(T\)` years:
  - The amount of money one would need to invest today to receive $X in `\(T\)` years, at a specified rate of interest, or **discount rate**, `\(r\)`

$$PDV = \frac{\text{\$}X}{(1+r)^{T}}$$
&lt;!-- - The discount rate refers to the rate at which future values are decreased to find an equivalent present value.  --&gt;

- The funds used to purchase Manhattan Island for $24 in 1626!
  - When invested at a 4.65 percent real interest rate, it would bring us the entire immense value of land in Manhattan today.

# Discounting Example: Lightbulbs
### &lt;p style="color:#00449E"&gt; &lt;/p&gt;


.panelset[
.panel[.panel-name[Switching to LED]
.pull-left[
&lt;img src="lec_figs/lightbulbs.png" width="85%" style="display: block; margin: auto;" /&gt;

]

.pull-right[
- New light emitting diode (LED) lightbulbs can replace standard incandescent bulbs, generate a similar quality of light, use around one-sixth of the electricity, and last around 40 times as long.
]

]

.panel[.panel-name[LED vs. Incandescent]
- Hotel needs a 1,000 new light bulbs

- LED costs $40,000 to buy up front and $500 each year for electricity

- Incandescent costs $10,000 each year to buy and $3,000 for electricity

&lt;img src="lec_figs/gp-tab8-1.png" width="85%" style="display: block; margin: auto;" /&gt;

]

.panel[.panel-name[PDV]
- Go with LED’s? It’s not that simple…

- We must calculate the present discounted value 

- The PDV will tell you how much, in today’s dollars, investment in LED bulbs saves over incandescent bulbs

$$
`\begin{align}
\text{PDV of Cash Flow} = -\frac{27,500}{(1 + r)^{0}} + \frac{12,500}{(1 + r)^{1}} + \frac{12,500}{(1 + r)^{2}}  + \frac{12,500}{(1 + r)^{3}}
\end{align}`
$$

- **Q**. So which is better, LED or incandescent? 



]

.panel[.panel-name[Discount Rate]

&lt;img src="lec_figs/gp-tab8-2.png" width="85%" style="display: block; margin: auto;" /&gt;

- It depends on the discount rate
  - The larger the discount rate, (1) the less important are future benefits and (2) the more important today's cost.
]

# Discounting and Benefit-Cost Analysis
### &lt;p style="color:#00449E"&gt; &lt;/p&gt;

- Private mangers maximizing their profit uses the market rate of interest on investments, which is determined in the market for loadable funds.

- For economists using benefit-cost analysis trying to decide what is efficient for society:

--

  - What discount rate to choose????

--

  - At what rate should society be compensated in the future for giving up a unit of consumption today such that overall well-being is preserved?

--

- It matters, a lot, for decisions where costs are more than 20 years out. 




---
# Discounting Climate Change
### &lt;p style="color:#00449E"&gt; &lt;/p&gt;

- With long time periods (e.g., climate change), the choice of discount rate becomes extremely important


&lt;img src="lec_figs/gp-tab8-3.png" width="65%" style="display: block; margin: auto;" /&gt;



---
# The Social Discount Rate and Dynamic Efficiency
### &lt;p style="color:#00449E"&gt; &lt;/p&gt;

.pull-left[
&lt;img src="lec_figs/ramsey.jpg" width="25%" style="display: block; margin: auto;" /&gt;

]

.pull-right[
The Ramsey equation:

$$
`\begin{align}
r = \delta + \eta g\qquad\qquad\qquad\qquad
\end{align}`
$$
]

--

- `\(\delta\,\)`: the rate of pure time preference (we are impatient)

--
- `\(g\,\)`: the growth rate of consumption in the economy

--
- `\(\eta\,\)`: the elasticity of the marginal utility of consumption
  - In other words, the utility value of extra income as a society grows richer
--

- The wealth effect: Together `\(g\)` and `\(\eta\)` constitute the growth rate of utility, the rate at which we grow happier.



---
# The Social Discount Rate and Dynamic Efficiency
### &lt;p style="color:#00449E"&gt; &lt;/p&gt;



- For example, when `\(\delta = 1\%\)`, `\(\eta = 2\)`, and `\(g = 2\%\)`, the social discount rate `\(r\)` is:

$$
`\begin{align}
r &amp;= \delta + \eta g\\
&amp;= 1\% + 2 * 2\%= 5\%
\end{align}`
$$

--

- The elasticity of the marginal utility of consumption ( `\(\eta &gt; 0\)` ) comes from the following form of utility:
$$
`\begin{align}
U(C) = \frac{C^{1-\eta}}{1-\eta}.
\end{align}`
$$

---
# Discounting Climate Change
### &lt;p style="color:#00449E"&gt; &lt;/p&gt;

- Recall Nicholas Stern’s projections from chapter 1 that we must cut 80% of CO2 by 2050. 
  - He assumes a low  1.4% discount rate, so that future damages play a big role in the analysis. 


$$
`\begin{align}
r &amp;= \delta + \eta g\\
&amp;= 0.1\% + 1 * 1.3\%\\
&amp;= 1.4\%
\end{align}`
$$
--

- William Nordhaus called for allowing global emissions to grow by 40%. 
  - His analysis was based on 5.5% discount rate, in which future damages get discounted close to zero.

# Future Benefits, Costs, and Discounting
### &lt;p style="color:#00449E"&gt; Environmental bond &lt;/p&gt;


.panelset[
.panel[.panel-name[(1)]

- Putting money aside into a bank account specifically to compensate future generations for pollution damages or depletion of natural capital is known as posting an **environmental bond**

.pull-left[

&lt;img src="lec_figs/env-bond-oilgas.png" width="75%" style="display: block; margin: auto;" /&gt;
]

.pull-right[

&lt;img src="lec_figs/env-bond-bottle.png" width="45%" style="display: block; margin: auto;" /&gt;
]

  &lt;!-- 1. Oil &amp; gas companies, mining companies, and generators of hazardous waste sometimes must post bonds sufficient to allow regulatory agencies to cover the cost of environmental cleanup and land reclamation  --&gt;

  &lt;!-- 2. A bottle deposit: If bottle deposits are not refunded, the unclaimed deposits can be used by the state or managing organization to support environmental cleanup activities. --&gt;



]


.panel[.panel-name[(2)]


- The potential for posting an environmental bond may offer us a rationale for spending less on prevention today than the full value of the damage we inflict on future generations.

  - The rationale is that the bond will cover the cost of any future environmental cleanup, so the immediate need to invest in prevention might seem less urgent.

# Strong Sustainability
### &lt;p style="color:#00449E"&gt; &lt;/p&gt;

- **Precautionary Principle**: Never reduce the stock of natural capital below a level that generates a sustained yield of services unless good substitutes are currently available for the services generated. 
  - When in doubt, conserve

- To determine the availability of substitutes requires focusing on **uniqueness** and **uncertainty** combined with **irreversibility**




---
# Strong Sustainability in Practice
### &lt;p style="color:#00449E"&gt; &lt;/p&gt;

- The **Endangered Species Act** is the only piece of U.S. legislation that requires strong sustainability


- **National Environmental Policy Act** (**NEPA**), requires a “light” version of the precautionary principle
  - Requires **environmental impact statement** (**EIS**) for “legislation or other major federal actions significantly affecting the quality of the human environment.”


- In the EU, **REACH** (**registration, evaluation, and authorization of chemicals**) requires chemical manufacturers to carry out health and environmental safety tests prior to introducing new chemicals
