# Cap-&amp;-trade: Auctions/Sales vs. Give-aways 
### &lt;p style="color:#00449E"&gt;  &lt;/p&gt;


.panelset[
.panel[.panel-name[Cap-and-trade system]

- In the cap-and-trade system, government sets a cap on the total amount of pollution emission.


- Government allocates the permits through one of two methods:
  1. Auctions or sales
  2. Free distribution (giveaways)

]

.panel[.panel-name[Auction/sales vs. Giveaway]
- If government sells permits to firms, cap-and-trade is equivalent to pollution taxes for firms


&lt;!-- - If government gives them to firms, cap-and-trade is like tax plus large transfer to initial polluting firms. --&gt;


- If permits are given away to firms free of charge, cap-and-trade costs much less for firms
  - Under pollution taxes or cap-and-trade auction, firms pay tax revenues plus clean-up costs
  - Under cap-and-trade with a give-away, firms pay only clean-up costs plus the costs of any additional permits. 
  - With permit give-aways, some firms may make money by selling excess permits

]

.panel[.panel-name[Coase Theorem]

- Coase Theorm Corollary
  - If there is a well-functioning permit market, a cost-effective outcome will be achieved by a marketable permit system regardless of the initial ownership of the permits

# Conclusion on giveaways versus auctions
### &lt;p style="color:#00449E"&gt;  &lt;/p&gt;

- Firms hate pollution taxes and auctioned cap-and-trade. 
  - They much prefer permit-give-aways under cap-and-trade.  
  - CAC is much less expensive to firms as well.


--


- Economists increasingly favor cap-and-trade auctions (or pollution taxes) over permit-giveaways
  - Double-dividend hypothesis
  - To insure that incentive-based approaches are not regressive

# Price vs. Quantity
### &lt;p style="color:#00449E"&gt; Imperfect Regulation in an Uncertain World &lt;/p&gt;

- The theory in IB systems is based upon the assumption of perfect information

  - Regulators were assumed to know everything about both the benefits and costs of pollution control
  
  - In the real world practice of regulation, this assumption is far from the truth

  - Permits have the advantage of providing a more certain level of pollution control than do emission taxes. 
  
  - This is because taxes have to be adjusted if regulators find pollutant levels resulting from a given tax are lower or higher than expected.



---
# Price vs. Quantity 
### &lt;p style="color:#00449E"&gt; &lt;/p&gt;

- With cap-and-trade, directly control the quantity of pollution emitted. 
  - Cap-and-trade is a **quantity** instrument


- With pollution taxes, regulators only indirectly control the quantity of pollution, by guessing at industry response to a tax of a certain level. 
  - Pollution taxes is a **price** instrument



---
# Price vs. Quantity 
### &lt;p style="color:#00449E"&gt; Martin Weitzman's seminal contribution &lt;/p&gt;



- 1960s economic research focus: Economic systems.
  - Key debate: Planned vs. market-based economies and their impact on prosperity.


- Marty's 1974 seminal work: "Prices versus Quantities".
  - Central question: Are prices or quantities better for resource allocation?


- Investigation of the above question in the context of uncertainty.


- With uncertainty in costs of reducing pollution, two policies are no longer equivalent.

&lt;!-- For instance, back in the 60s, a thriving part of economic research focussed on economic systems. In those days the jury was steadfastly out on which type of economy, planned versus decentralised and market based, would lead to greater prosperity. Put simply, would prices provide the correct signals for the allocation resources, or should we rather focus on managing, allocating and fixing quantities? 

&lt;!-- This was the backdrop for Marty’s seminal contribution, “Prices versus Quantities”, (Review of Economic Studies, 1974) in which this question was investigated in the context of uncertainty. 

&lt;!-- Marty showed that the economist’s proclivity for price regulation could easily be erroneous, and in some important cases quantity regulation would be better for society. 

&lt;!-- Importantly for the field of environmental economics, Marty used the example of pollution control to make his point where the logic of the results was most powerful. 

&lt;!-- In essence, when there is uncertainty about marginal pollution abatement costs and pollution damages, where small changes in pollution cause rapidly increasing damages, quantity restrictions better limit any pollution overshoot, and minimize social costs when policies are set imperfectly beforehand. 

&lt;!-- Otherwise, price regulation (pollution taxes) are better. 

&lt;!-- Since then this logic has been applied to guide the policy choice between tradable permit schemes and Pigouvian taxes in the regulation of acid rain, climate change, water pollution, inter alia. The pure economic logic found its home and chief applications in environmental policy. --&gt;

# Price vs. Quantity
&lt;!-- ### &lt;p style="color:#00449E"&gt; Regulation with Imperfect Information &lt;/p&gt; --&gt;

&lt;!-- - When the marginal benefit curve is steep, regulators will want to keep tight control over the actual quantity of pollutant released to ensure the threshold is not far exceeded --&gt;

- When the marginal benefit curve is steep, a marketable permit system is preferred to a pollution tax because of the costs of being wrong.


- When the marginal benefit curve is flat, a pollution tax is preferred to a marketable permit system because of the costs of being wrong.


--


- The instrument choice depends on whether the government wants to get the amount of pollution reduction right or whether it wants to minimize costs to firms.
  - Quantity regulations ensure environmental protection, but at a variable cost to firms, while price regulations ensure the cost to the firms, but at a variable level of environmental protection

&lt;!-- # Price vs. Quantity --&gt;
&lt;!-- ### &lt;p style="color:#00449E"&gt; Regulation with Imperfect Information &lt;/p&gt; --&gt;

&lt;!-- - When the social costs of being wrong arise more from increased compliance costs and less from the benefits of reduction, a tax policy will be preferred --&gt;

&lt;!-- - For the case of climate change, which one is more favorable to the other? --&gt;

# IB Regulation and Technological Progress
### &lt;p style="color:#00449E"&gt;  &lt;/p&gt;

- Taxes and permits generate better incentives for **long-run technological progress** in pollution control than CAC 
  - Taxes: less pollution means lower taxes
  - Permits: pollution bears an opportunity costs since less pollution frees up permits for sale


- In both cases, since pollution is now costly to firms, they have a motivation to continuously seek out new ways of reducing pollution


---
# Incentives for New Technology Under IB and CAC
### &lt;p style="color:#00449E"&gt;  &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;img src="lec_figs/gp-fig15-2.png" width="50%" style="display: block; margin: auto;" /&gt;

- Under CAC, there is no incentive to reduce pollution below the delagated emission standard, `\(P_{1}\)`.



---
# Incentives for New Technology Under IB and CAC
### &lt;p style="color:#00449E"&gt;  &lt;/p&gt;

- Under CAC, sometimes new sources and old sources of pollution have different standards.


- This “grandfathering” gives less stringent standards to old sources and leads more polluting sources to stay online longer than they should (this is called a **new-source bias**)

--


- One study found that 
  - The average age of power plants in the states with nine of the strictest emission standards was 15-16.5 years, compared to 11.5 years for the rest of the states. 
  - The power plants might experience a 'technological lock-in', where they continue to rely on older, but compliant technology of electicity generation.

# Potential Problems with IB Regulation
### &lt;p style="color:#00449E"&gt; Taxes and Permits Compared &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;img src="lec_figs/gp-tab15-3.png" width="90%" style="display: block; margin: auto;" /&gt;


---
# Potential Problems with IB Regulation
### &lt;p style="color:#00449E"&gt;  &lt;/p&gt;

- Two Problems w/ both Pollution Taxes and cap-and-trade:
  - Need for direct monitoring of emissions and enforcement of violations
  - Hot-spots: high local concentrations of pollutants


- Monitoring 
  - Emissions monitoring is a GOOD thing, but it has to be built into the system up front. IB regulations cannot work without direct monitoring of emissions.  




---
# Hot Spots
### &lt;p style="color:#00449E"&gt;  &lt;/p&gt;

- **Uniformly mixed pollutant**
  - Emissions concentrations are spread evenly over multiple areas


- **Concentrated pollutant**
  - All the damage done by emissions of a plant occur in the plant’s area

- **Nonuniformly mixed pollutant**
  - The bulk of the damage is done locally, but effects do drift into other areas


- IB systems create **hot-spots** for concentrated and nonuniformly mixed pollutants



---
# Nonuniformly mixed Pollutants in Grimeville
### &lt;p style="color:#00449E"&gt;  &lt;/p&gt;


&lt;img src="lec_figs/gp-fig15-3.png" width="65%" style="display: block; margin: auto;" /&gt;

-  Taxes would have to be higher (or the emissions value of a permit lower) in already polluted areas


---
# Problems with Permit Systems
### &lt;p style="color:#00449E"&gt;  &lt;/p&gt;

- Thin markets--markets with only a few buyers and sellers


- Price Volatility! (e.g., RECLAIM, ETS)


- Potential for market power:
  - Most likely if new firms are forced to buy permits from direct competitors


- Permit life
  - Short permit lives quickly lose value and are not worth trading
  - Firms must be able to bank their permits--if a reduction is made in one year, the permit can be saved for trade in a later year





---
# Problems with Pollution Taxes
### &lt;p style="color:#00449E"&gt;  &lt;/p&gt;


- With taxes, regulators do not know in advance the actual level of pollution that will emerge. Tax must be raised if not enough pollution is reduced. 

- Taxes must be continually adjusted upward to hold pollution constant in the face of both economic growth and inflation.
