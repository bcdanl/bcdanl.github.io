# Price vs. Quantity
### &lt;p style="color:#00449E"&gt; Imperfect Regulation in an Uncertain World &lt;/p&gt;

- The theory in IB systems is based upon the assumption of perfect information

  - Regulators were assumed to know everything about both the benefits and costs of pollution control
  
  - In the real world practice of regulation, this assumption is far from the truth

  - Permits have the advantage of providing a more certain level of pollution control than do emission taxes. 
  
  - This is because taxes have to be adjusted if regulators find pollutant levels resulting from a given tax are lower or higher than expected.



---
# Price vs. Quantity 
### &lt;p style="color:#00449E"&gt; &lt;/p&gt;

- With cap-and-trade, directly control the quantity of pollution emitted. 
  - Cap-and-trade is a **quantity** instrument


- With pollution taxes, regulators only indirectly control the quantity of pollution, by guessing at industry response to a tax of a certain level. 
  - Pollution taxes is a **price** instrument



---
# Price vs. Quantity 
### &lt;p style="color:#00449E"&gt; Martin Weitzman's seminal contribution &lt;/p&gt;



- 1960s economic research focus: Economic systems.
  - Key debate: Planned vs. market-based economies and their impact on prosperity.


- Marty's 1974 seminal work: "Prices versus Quantities".
  - Central question: Are prices or quantities better for resource allocation?


- Investigation of the above question in the context of uncertainty.


- With uncertainty in costs of reducing pollution, two policies are no longer equivalent.

&lt;!-- For instance, back in the 60s, a thriving part of economic research focussed on economic systems. In those days the jury was steadfastly out on which type of economy, planned versus decentralised and market based, would lead to greater prosperity. Put simply, would prices provide the correct signals for the allocation resources, or should we rather focus on managing, allocating and fixing quantities? 

&lt;!-- This was the backdrop for Marty’s seminal contribution, “Prices versus Quantities”, (Review of Economic Studies, 1974) in which this question was investigated in the context of uncertainty. 

&lt;!-- Marty showed that the economist’s proclivity for price regulation could easily be erroneous, and in some important cases quantity regulation would be better for society. 

&lt;!-- Importantly for the field of environmental economics, Marty used the example of pollution control to make his point where the logic of the results was most powerful. 

&lt;!-- In essence, when there is uncertainty about marginal pollution abatement costs and pollution damages, where small changes in pollution cause rapidly increasing damages, quantity restrictions better limit any pollution overshoot, and minimize social costs when policies are set imperfectly beforehand. 

&lt;!-- Otherwise, price regulation (pollution taxes) are better. 

&lt;!-- Since then this logic has been applied to guide the policy choice between tradable permit schemes and Pigouvian taxes in the regulation of acid rain, climate change, water pollution, inter alia. The pure economic logic found its home and chief applications in environmental policy. --&gt;

# Price vs. Quantity
&lt;!-- ### &lt;p style="color:#00449E"&gt; Regulation with Imperfect Information &lt;/p&gt; --&gt;

&lt;!-- - When the marginal benefit curve is steep, regulators will want to keep tight control over the actual quantity of pollutant released to ensure the threshold is not far exceeded --&gt;

- When the marginal benefit curve is steep, a marketable permit system is preferred to a pollution tax because of the costs of being wrong.


- When the marginal benefit curve is flat, a pollution tax is preferred to a marketable permit system because of the costs of being wrong.


--


- The instrument choice depends on whether the government wants to get the amount of pollution reduction right or whether it wants to minimize costs to firms.
  - Quantity regulations ensure environmental protection, but at a variable cost to firms, while price regulations ensure the cost to the firms, but at a variable level of environmental protection

&lt;!-- --- --&gt;
&lt;!-- # Price vs. Quantity --&gt;
&lt;!-- ### &lt;p style="color:#00449E"&gt; Regulation with Imperfect Information &lt;/p&gt; --&gt;

&lt;!-- - When the social costs of being wrong arise more from increased compliance costs and less from the benefits of reduction, a tax policy will be preferred --&gt;

&lt;!-- - For the case of climate change, which one is more favorable to the other? --&gt;

# IB Regulation and Technological Progress
### &lt;p style="color:#00449E"&gt;  &lt;/p&gt;

- Taxes and permits generate better incentives for **long-run technological progress** in pollution control than CAC 
  - Taxes: less pollution means lower taxes
  - Permits: pollution bears an opportunity costs since less pollution frees up permits for sale


- In both cases, since pollution is now costly to firms, they have a motivation to continuously seek out new ways of reducing pollution


---
# Incentives for New Technology Under IB and CAC
### &lt;p style="color:#00449E"&gt;  &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;img src="lec_figs/gp-fig15-2.png" width="50%" style="display: block; margin: auto;" /&gt;

- Under CAC, there is no incentive to reduce pollution below the delagated emission standard, `\(P_{1}\)`.



---
# Incentives for New Technology Under IB and CAC
### &lt;p style="color:#00449E"&gt;  &lt;/p&gt;

- Under CAC, sometimes new sources and old sources of pollution have different standards.


- This “grandfathering” gives less stringent standards to old sources and leads more polluting sources to stay online longer than they should (this is called a **new-source bias**)

--


- One study found that 
  - The average age of power plants in the states with nine of the strictest emission standards was 15-16.5 years, compared to 11.5 years for the rest of the states. 
  - The power plants might experience a 'technological lock-in', where they continue to rely on older, but compliant technology of electicity generation.

# Potential Problems with IB Regulation
### &lt;p style="color:#00449E"&gt; Taxes and Permits Compared &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;img src="lec_figs/gp-tab15-3.png" width="100%" style="display: block; margin: auto;" /&gt;


---
# Potential Problems with IB Regulation
### &lt;p style="color:#00449E"&gt;  &lt;/p&gt;

- Two Problems w/ both pollution taxes and cap-and-trade:
  - Need for direct monitoring of emissions and enforcement of violations
  - **Hot-spots**: high local concentrations of pollutants


- Monitoring 
  - Emissions monitoring is a GOOD thing, but it has to be built into the system up front. 
  - IB regulations cannot work without direct monitoring of emissions.  
  




---
# Hot Spots
### &lt;p style="color:#00449E"&gt;  &lt;/p&gt;

- **Uniformly mixed pollutant**
  - Emissions concentrations are spread evenly over multiple areas
  - E.g., Chlorofluorocarbons (CFCs) and CO2

--


- **Concentrated pollutant**
  - All the damage done by emissions of a plant occur in the plant’s area
  - E.g., Nuclear waste

--


- **Nonuniformly mixed pollutant**
  - The bulk of the damage is done locally, but effects do drift into other areas
  - To deal with the hot-spot problem in the nonuniformly mixed pollutants, economists have recommended trades (or taxes) based on the contribution of emissions to ambient air or water quality.
  - Ambient air quality refers to the average quality of air in a particular region.

&lt;!-- - IB systems create **hot-spots** for concentrated and nonuniformly mixed pollutants --&gt;


---
# National Ambient Air Quality Standards
### &lt;p style="color:#00449E"&gt;  &lt;/p&gt;


- EPA developed **National Ambient Air Quality Standards** (NAAQS). 

&lt;img src="lec_figs/gp-tab13-1.png" width="85%" style="display: block; margin: auto;" /&gt;



---
# Nonuniformly mixed Pollutants in Grimeville
### &lt;p style="color:#00449E"&gt;  &lt;/p&gt;


&lt;img src="lec_figs/gp-fig15-3.png" width="65%" style="display: block; margin: auto;" /&gt;

- How much emissions will residents in each region face?

&lt;!-- -  Taxes would have to be higher (or the emissions value of a permit lower) in already polluted areas --&gt;


---
# Nonuniformly mixed Pollutants in Grimeville
### &lt;p style="color:#00449E"&gt;  &lt;/p&gt;



- The Grimeville authorities would need to impose an ambient air-quality standard of 10 tons for each region, and then control emissions in the two regions to meet the ambient standards. 


- To do so using a tax approach would require higher pollution taxes in area A than in area B.


- Alternatively, if marketable permits were to be used, a given permit would allow lower emissions in area A than in area B.


---
# Nonuniformly mixed Pollutants in Grimeville
### &lt;p style="color:#00449E"&gt;  &lt;/p&gt;

- In general, taxes would have to be higher (or the emissions value of a permit lower) in already polluted areas


- To determine the exact tax rate or terms of trade for permits (e.g, validity period of permits), the relationship between emissions and ambient standards should be known.
   
   
- If hot-spot problems proliferate, tax or permit schemes can rapidly grow in complexity, thereby losing their main benefit for regulators – simplicity.

---
# Monotoring and Compliance
### &lt;p style="color:#00449E"&gt;  &lt;/p&gt;

- One of the primary monitoring techniques used under the CAC system is simply to ensure that firms have actually installed the required abatement technology.
  - E.g., Catalytic converters on cars

--


- IB regulation does not specify particular pollution control technologies with known abatement impacts.
  - Regulators must rely even more heavily on (currently inadequate) monitoring of emissions to ensure compliance with permits or to collect taxes.

--


- To maximize the effectiveness of a regulation system based on incentives in lowering pollution cost-effectively, there must be a dedication to rigorous monitoring and tough enforcement that remains unaffected by budget cuts.




---
# Enforcement
### &lt;p style="color:#00449E"&gt;  &lt;/p&gt;

- From the enforcement perspective, taxes have an advantage over permit systems.
  - Regulators have an economic incentive to monitor emissions closely to ensure maximum tax revenues. 
  

- The introduction of taxes on water pollutants in Germany has led government to require better monitoring technologies and to become more aggressive in enforcement.



---
# Problems with Permit Systems
### &lt;p style="color:#00449E"&gt; Thin markets &lt;/p&gt;

- Markets with only a few buyers and sellers

- In thin markets where trades are infrequent and prices not easily defined, IB systems are also hampered by imperfect information.

- Acid rain pollution permits are traded on the futures markets in Chicago. Plant managers can read in the newspaper the going price for an SO2 credit, greatly reducing informational barriers to trade.



---
# Problems with Permit Systems
### &lt;p style="color:#00449E"&gt; Market power &lt;/p&gt;



.panelset[
.panel[.panel-name[Barrier to entry]

- Most likely if new firms are forced to buy permits from direct competitors


- Concerns here typically focus on access to permits as a *barrier to entry*. 


- What if existing firms refuse to sell to new entrants in the market as a way to limit competition?


- This may be a problem when the two circumstances (1) and (2) hold.

]

.panel[.panel-name[(1)]
Condition (1)---New firms are forced to buy permits from direct competitors---does not generally hold.

- E.g., Under the acid rain program, for example, SO2 trades are nationwide; 

]

.panel[.panel-name[(2)]
- Condition (2)---A single dominant firm faces new entrants with higher pollution-control costs---is necessary for the market power problem to hold.

- If there are several existing large firms in the industry, the benefits of excluding new rivals to any given firm are lower. 

- Moreover, the existing firms must maintain an informal agreement not to sell.

- As the price new entrants are willing to pay for permits rises, each firm will have an incentive to cheat on this agreement.

]

.panel[.panel-name[Problem?]

- The CAC approach has its own entry barriers associated with high cost of compliance for new sources. 

- Economists disagree on how significant this market power problem is. 

- The market problem can be big enough to seriously undermine the appeal of IB regulation. 

- Concern should be focused on designing IB systems to minimize these problems. 

- Permit giveaways that endow large firms with a substantial share of the permits should be avoided.

# Problems with Permit Systems
### &lt;p style="color:#00449E"&gt; Price volatility &lt;/p&gt;



.panelset[
.panel[.panel-name[Problem]

- More serious problem with cap-and-trade systems relates to price volatility. 

- The annual stock of permits is in fixed supply: in the absence of banking, it is perfectly inelastic. 

- Thus any changes in demand can lead to large swings in permit prices. 

]


.panel[.panel-name[Example]

- Regional Clean Air Incentives Market (RECLAIM): A rapid run-up in demand by fossil fuel electricity generators during the West Coast electricity shortages in the early 2000s sent NOx permit prices skyrocketing and led to the temporary cancellation of the program. 


- European Trading System (ETS): In Europe, prices for carbon permits have also been fairly volatile, though in the opposite direction, and have undergone repeated periods of collapse.

]



.panel[.panel-name[Why?]

*1*. When price goes unexpectedly high, it makes it hard for firms to rely on market purchases to cover unexpected compliance needs. 

  - In volatile markets, firms will hang on to all their permits to make sure that they have enough for compliance. 
  
  - At the high end, volatility discourages market participation and the cost savings that might arise from permit sales. 

]


.panel[.panel-name[Why?]

*2*. When prices unexpectedly collapse, firms’ incentives to invest in long-term pollution-reduction measures are undercut. 
 
  - Rather than the costly investments, firms might reckon they will be better off just buying permits.
]



.panel[.panel-name[Banking]

- One way to dampen volatility is to allow banking: 


- If firms can carry over unused permits from year to year, then during periods of low prices, firms are likely to hold onto permits (helping firm up the market price), for use or sale during high price periods (helping to moderate those price increases). 


- On the down side, banking does raise the possibility of temporal *hot spots*. 
  - If all the banked permits were used in a short time, pollution rates during that period would skyrocket. 


]

.panel[.panel-name[Price collar]

- A second tool is a government-set **price floor** combined with a government-set **price ceiling**. 

- Under this scenario, government buys permits when the price falls below the floor and then bids prices back up to the minimum. 

- If the government then banks these permits, they can hold them to periods when the price rises above the ceiling. 

- By selling their excess stock, they can drive the price down below the ceiling. 

]

]



---
# Problems with Permit Systems
### &lt;p style="color:#00449E"&gt; Permit Giveaways &lt;/p&gt;

- Firms profit from receiving permits free of charge in two ways. 
  
  1. If they face low-cost reduction opportunities, they can sell permits and make money. 
  
  2. Because IB regulation raises the marginal cost of pollution produced, these increased
marginal costs get passed on to consumers in the form of higher prices.



---
# Windfall Profits from Rising Prices
### &lt;p style="color:#00449E"&gt; Permit Prices Are Passed on to Consumers in Competitive Markets &lt;/p&gt;


&lt;img src="lec_figs/gp-fig15-4.png" width="50%" style="display: block; margin: auto;" /&gt;

- All the firms to the left of `\(Q_{1}\)` receive permits for free.
- All the new entrants into the market to the right of `\(Q_{1}\)` must purchase permits for a price equal to the vertical line segment at the kink: ( `\(P_{2}–P_{1}\)` ).

---
# Problems with Pollution Taxes
### &lt;p style="color:#00449E"&gt;  &lt;/p&gt;


- With taxes, regulators do not know in advance the actual level of pollution that will emerge. 
  - Tax must be raised if not enough pollution is reduced. 


- Taxes must be continually adjusted upward to hold pollution constant in the face of both economic growth and inflation.
  - It may not be easy to adjust taxes.



---
# Problems with Pollution Taxes
### &lt;p style="color:#00449E"&gt; Why use taxes instead of permits? &lt;/p&gt;


1. To avoid the transactions costs associated with monitoring trades in the permit market. 

2. To guard against high costs from an overly ambitious pollution cap.

3. To make environmental policy less regressive by using tax revenue

4. To have double dividend by using tax revenue



---
# Problems with Pollution Taxes
### &lt;p style="color:#00449E"&gt; Cap-and-trade with 100% auction &lt;/p&gt;

- Both rebates and stronger enforcement incentives are possible if cap-and-trade relies on 100% auction of the permits. 

- With 100% auction cap-and-trade, the government sets a quantity target for allowable pollution, and the market determines the price of pollution. 

- With pollution taxes, the government sets a price target for pollution, and the market responds by reducing quantity. 

- If the final prices work out to be the same, then the two policies should generate identical impacts in terms of both pollution reduction and government revenues.
