# Welcome to `pagedown-cv`
This repository  different examples of building a cv with [`rmarkdown`](https://rmarkdown.rstudio.com) and [`pagedown`](https://github.com/rstudio/pagedown), illustrated with my personal resumé.

(NOTE: for now 1-3 only works properly in Chrome, as some aspects of CSS Paged Media are only supported by this browser):

1. [Paged, academic resume (**one-column-paged-academic.Rmd**)](one-column-paged-academic.html)
1. [Paged, 2-column brief resume (**two-column-paged-brief.Rmd**)](two-column-paged-brief.html)
1. [Paged, 1-column resume (**one-column-paged.Rmd**)](one-column-paged.html)
1. [Ordinary scrolling HTML resume (**one-column.Rmd**)](one-column.html)
1. [Ordinary scrolling HTML resume, formatted in the style of an old version of my personal website (**website-cv.Rmd**)](website-cv.html)
1. (For an in-practice example of the website cv, [see the current version on my website](https://ulriklyngs.com/cv/))

## But why?
I liked the idea of making a CV easier to maintain by separating the content from the output (see e.g. Nick Strayer's [data-driven cv](http://nickstrayer.me/datadrivencv/)). 

The brilliant [`pagedown`](https://github.com/rstudio/pagedown) package makes it possible to output an R Markdown file to paged HTML content which can then be saved as PDF.
This means we can easily use R Markdown to programmatically pull out content from some spreadsheet with our CV data, output it to a paged format, and do the styling with CSS. Brilliant!

However, I didn't find he base format for resumés provided by `pagedown` (`pagedown::html_resume`) particularly aesthetically pleasing, so I developed my own paged formats.

## Which do you use?
My currently favoured format for academic purposes (example 1) was inspired by, amongst others, the resumé of [Matthew Kay](http://www.mjskay.com/):

::: {.example-cv}
![](examples/cur_cv_pg1.jpg){ width=40% } ![](examples/cur_cv_pg2.jpg){ width=40% }
:::

The two-column resume layout I mainly use for brief, 2-page resumés. I originally made this layout in Microsoft Word (!). After I became enamoured with R Markdown, I at some point set out to recreate this with `pagedown` (example 2):

::: {.example-cv}
![](examples/page1_new.png){ width=40% } ![](examples/page2.png){ width=40% }
:::


## How does it work?
Each resumé is generated by an R Markdown file and pulls in its content from **\_content/cv_entries.csv** and **\_content/publications.csv**.

The CSV files with the content are just local copies of the corresponding tabs in [this google sheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1ta71CAGkcLqm-W1UdVRA_JJSddWV2TsrRZsCnQlmOis/edit?usp=sharing), which holds most of the content for [my website](https://ulriklyngs.com/).

The R script **\_content/sync_w_gsheets.R** grabs the current content of the 'cv_entries' and the 'publications' tabs in the google sheet and stores it in the **\_content** folder.


## How can I use it?
To use this for your own CV, download or clone the GitHub repo: https://github.com/ulyngs/pagedown-cv/ 

Then replace the content in the CSV files with your own stuff and tweak the **.Rmd** files accordingly.
