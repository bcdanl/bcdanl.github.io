## Set Up Your Project and Load Libraries

To begin we must load some libraries we will be using. If we do not load them, R will not be able to find the functions contained in these libraries. The tidyverse includes ggplot and other tools. We also load the socviz and gapminder libraries.

```{r setup, include=FALSE}

## By defult, show code for all chunks in the knitted document,
## as well as the output. To override for a particular chunk
## use echo = FALSE in its options.
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE) 

## Set the default size of figures
knitr::opts_chunk$set(fig.width=8, fig.height=5)  

## Load the libraries we will be using
library(gapminder)
library(here)
library(socviz)
library(tidyverse)


```

## Python

```{python}
x = 3
y = 4
z = x + y
print(z)
```

```{python}
x = 3
y = 4
z = x + y
print(z)

```
