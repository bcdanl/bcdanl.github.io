    "text": "Let’s consider a Public Goods Game with deforestation.\n\n\nA village is located near a dense forest. The forest provides essential resources to the village, such as wood for fuel, fruits, and medicinal herbs. However, the forest also acts as a carbon sink, absorbing carbon dioxide and helping to regulate the climate. If too many trees are cut down, not only will the forest’s resources be depleted, but the local climate may also become more unstable, leading to long-term consequences for the village.\n\n\n\n\nPlayers: Each player represents a household in the village. Every household relies on the forest for resources but also understands the long-term benefits of conservation.\nInitial Endowment: Each household starts with 100 units of currency.\nDecision: Each round, households decide how many trees to cut down. Each tree cut down gives immediate benefits (e.g., 10 units of currency per tree). However, if the total number of trees cut by all households exceeds a certain threshold, the forest will degrade, leading to negative consequences for all players in subsequent rounds.\nPublic Pot: Instead of cutting trees, households can choose to contribute some of their currency to a public pot, which represents a community fund for forest conservation and sustainable resource management.\nMultiplication and Distribution: At the end of each round, contributions to the public pot are used for reforestation and sustainable initiatives. For every unit of currency in the pot, the community fund plants new trees or invests in sustainable practices, multiplying the pot’s value by a factor 1.5. The benefits (like a stable climate, continued access to forest resources) are then equally distributed among all households, irrespective of individual contributions.\n\nSuppose there are four households. In the first round:\n\nHousehold A cuts 3 trees, earning 30 units.\nHousehold B cuts 2 trees, earning 20 units, and contributes 20 units to the public pot.\nHousehold C cuts 0 trees (choosing conservation) and contributes 50 units to the public pot.\nHousehold D cuts 4 trees, earning 40 units.\n\n\n\nWhat is the total contribution to the public pot in the first round?\n\n\n\n\nHow much units of\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe total contribution to the public pot is (20 + 50 = 70) units. This amount is multiplied by 1.5 (for reforestation efforts), resulting in 105 units of environmental benefit distributed equally among the households.\n\n\n\n\nIf too many trees are cut collectively, the forest degrades, leading to reduced benefits in subsequent rounds.\nHouseholds face the dilemma of gaining immediate benefits from cutting trees versus the long-term communal benefits of conservation.\nThe game illustrates the tension between individual short-term gains and collective long-term benefits, mirroring real-world environmental challenges like deforestation, overfishing, and pollution.\n\nThis game can be used to study how communities balance immediate needs with long-term sustainability and the factors that influence cooperative behavior in environmental conservation."

    "text": "The Public Goods Game is a standard of experimental economics used primarily to study the free-rider problem and cooperation among individuals. In this game, participants are given a sum of money and are offered the opportunity to contribute some or all of it to a public pot. The money in this pot is then multiplied by a factor greater than one but less than the number of players, and the resulting amount is distributed equally among all players, regardless of their individual contributions.\n\n\n\nInitial Endowment: Each player starts with an initial amount of money (e.g., $10).\nContribution: Players decide how much of their initial endowment to contribute to a public pot. They can contribute nothing, everything, or anything in between.\nMultiplication: The total amount in the public pot is multiplied by a factor (e.g., 1.5).\nDistribution: The multiplied amount is then equally distributed among all players, irrespective of their individual contributions.\n\n\n\n\nLet’s consider a simple example with four players, each initially endowed with $10. They have to decide how much to contribute to a public pot.\n\nPlayer A contributes $8\nPlayer B contributes $6\nPlayer C contributes $0 (free-rider)\nPlayer D contributes $4\n\nThe total amount in the public pot is (8 + 6 + 0 + 4 = $18).\nThis amount is then multiplied by a factor, say 1.5, resulting in (18 = $27).\nFinally, the $27 is distributed equally among the four players, giving each (27 / 4 = $6.75).\n\n\n\n\nPlayer A: Started with $10, contributed $8, received $6.75. Final amount: (10 - 8 + 6.75 = $8.75)\nPlayer B: Started with $10, contributed $6, received $6.75. Final amount: (10 - 6 + 6.75 = $10.75)\nPlayer C: Started with $10, contributed $0, received $6.75. Final amount: (10 - 0 + 6.75 = $16.75) (benefited most by free-riding)\nPlayer D: Started with $10, contributed $4, received $6.75. Final amount: (10 - 4 + 6.75 = $12.75)\n\n\n\n\n\nFree-Rider Problem: Players like C who contribute nothing still receive a share of the public good, illustrating the free-rider problem.\nIncentive to Defect: Rational, self-interested players have an incentive to contribute nothing and free-ride on the contributions of others.\nCollective Action Problem: If everyone acts in their self-interest, the public good is under-provided, leading to suboptimal outcomes for the group.\nCooperation and Norms: In many real-world experiments, some level of contribution is observed, indicating that factors like altruism, social norms, or the prospect of future interactions can promote cooperation.\n\nThe Public Goods Game is a powerful tool for studying the complexities of cooperation and the provision of public goods, offering insights into how and why people contribute to collective endeavors."

    "text": "The Cobb-Douglas utility function is\n\\[\n\\begin{align}\nu(x_{1}, x_{2}) = x_{1}^{\\alpha}x_{2}^{\\beta}.\n\\end{align}\n\\] Since utility functions are only defined up to a monotonic transformation, it is convenient to take logs of this expression and work with:\n\\[\n\\begin{align}\n\\log u(x_{1}, x_{2}) = \\alpha \\log x_{1} + \\beta \\log x_{2}.\n\\end{align}\n\\]\n\nBy the way, a monotonic transformation is a way of transforming one set of numbers into another set of numbers in a way that the order of the numbers is preserved.\n\nTherefore, a monotonic transformation of a utility function preserves the order of the utility values.\nIf bundle \\(A\\) is preferred to bundle \\(B\\), then a monotonic transformation of the utility function will still show that \\(A\\) is preferred to \\(B\\).\n\n\nLet’s find the demand functions for \\(x_1\\) and \\(x_2\\) for the Cobb-Douglas utility function. The problem we want to solve is\n\\[\n\\begin{align}\n\\max_{x_{1}, x_{2}}&\\; \\log u(x_{1}, x_{2}) = \\alpha \\log x_{1} + \\beta \\log x_{2} \\tag{1}\\\\\n\\text{such that}&\\quad Y \\;\\geq\\; p_{1}x_{1} + p_{2}x_{2} \\tag{2}\n\\end{align}\n\\]\nThere are at least two ways to solve this problem.\n\n\nSince “the more, the better” holds for this consumer, the budget constraint holds with equality at the optimum. Using this fact, we can then substitute out \\(x_{2}\\) in problem (1) using the budget constraint (2) with equality.\n\\[\n\\begin{align}\n\\max_{x_{1}}&\\; \\log u(x_{1}) = \\alpha \\log x_{1} + \\beta \\log \\left(\\frac{Y - p_{1}x_{1}}{p_{2}}\\right) \\tag{3}\n\\end{align}\n\\] The first order condition for problem (3) is\n\\[\n\\begin{align}\n\\frac{\\alpha}{x_{1}} + \\frac{\\beta}{\\left(\\frac{Y - p_{1}x_{1}}{p_{2}}\\right)}\\left(-\\frac{p_{1}}{p_{2}}\\right) \\,=\\, 0.  \\tag{4}\n\\end{align}\n\\] Re-arranging the first-order condition (4) and the budget constraint (2) with equality gives the demand for \\(x_{1}\\) and \\(x_{2}\\):\n\\[\n\\begin{align}\nx_{1}^{*} = \\frac{\\alpha}{\\alpha + \\beta} \\frac{Y}{p_{1}},\\\\\nx_{2}^{*} = \\frac{\\beta}{\\alpha + \\beta} \\frac{Y}{p_{2}}.\n\\end{align}\n\\]\n\n\n\nNow for Lagrange’s method for the problem (1) with constraint (2). Set up the Lagrangian: \\[\n\\mathcal{L} = \\alpha\\log x_{1} + \\beta\\log x_{2} + \\lambda(Y - p_{1}x_{1} - p_{2}x_{2}). \\tag{5}\n\\] Differentiate (5) with respect to each of the choice variables, \\(x_{1}, x_{2}\\), and \\(\\lambda\\) to get the three first-order conditions:\n\\[\n\\begin{align}\n\\frac{\\partial\\mathcal{L}}{\\partial x_{1}} &= \\frac{\\alpha}{x_{1}} - \\lambda p_{1} = 0, \\tag{6}\\\\\n\\frac{\\partial\\mathcal{L}}{\\partial x_{2}} &= \\frac{\\beta}{x_{2}} - \\lambda p_{2} = 0, \\tag{7}\\\\\n\\frac{\\partial\\mathcal{L}}{\\partial x_{1}} &= Y - p_{1}x_{1} - p_{2}x_{2} = 0. \\tag{8}\\\\\n\\end{align}\n\\] Now we are to solve the system of equations—three unknowns (\\(x_{1}, x_{2}\\), and \\(\\lambda\\)), three equations (6), (7), and (8).\nRearranging (6) and (7) gives: \\[\n\\begin{align}\nx_{1} = \\frac{\\alpha}{\\lambda p_{1}},\\tag{8}\\\\\nx_{2} = \\frac{\\beta}{\\lambda p_{2}}.\\tag{9}\n\\end{align}\n\\]\nNow we need to find \\(\\lambda\\).\nRearranging (6) and (7) also gives: \\[\n\\begin{align}\n\\alpha  &= \\lambda p_{1}x_{1},\\\\\n\\beta  &= \\lambda p_{2}x_{2}.\n\\end{align}\n\\] Adding the equations above gives:\n\\[\n\\alpha + \\beta = \\lambda(p_{1}x_{1} + p_{2}x_{2}) = \\lambda Y,\n\\] which gives us\n\\[\n\\lambda = \\frac{\\alpha + \\beta}{Y}.\\tag{10}\n\\]\nSubstitute (10) back into (8) and (9) and solve for \\(x_{1}\\) and \\(x_{2}\\) to get\n\\[\n\\begin{align}\nx_{1}^{*} = \\frac{\\alpha}{\\alpha + \\beta} \\frac{Y}{p_{1}},\\\\\nx_{2}^{*} = \\frac{\\beta}{\\alpha + \\beta} \\frac{Y}{p_{2}},\n\\end{align}\n\\]\njust as before."

Because Amazon is actually made richer when she is compensated for giving up the “Quadrupling the Amazon Forest” project than when she pays to expand the forest area, WTA is higher than WTP."

The average travel costs must be $60, if 4 trips are taken. Therefore, CS is \\(\\frac{1}{2}\\times(100-60)\\times4 = \\$80\\).\nTotal CS is average CS times the expected number of visitors: \\(50,000*\\$80 = \\$4,000,000\\)."

    "text": "Recently, the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency issued regulations covering the design and construction of landfills for municipal solid waste. Landfills can represent a threat to environmental health if toxic chemicals leach from the waste into surrounding ground or surface waters. \nThe regulations require certain design, construction and maintenance standards extending beyond the post-closure period, including, in most cases, installation of impermeable liners and covers and groundwater monitoring. The purpose of the regulations was to ensure safe containment of solid waste and to prevent future generations from having to bear clean-up costs from poorly-disposed waste. \nEven with the new regulations, just under 10% of landfills will still pose what the EPA considers to be a “moderate” health risk for individuals who depend on contaminated groundwater: a greater than 1 in 1,000,000 increase in the risk of contracting cancer. However, because so few people actually depend on ground water within leaching distance of a landfill, the new regulations were predicted to reduce cancer by only 2 or 3 cases over the next 300 years. Potential benefits of the regulation not quantified by the EPA include: increased ease of siting landfills, reduced damage to surface water, fairness to future generations and an overall reduction in waste generation and related “upstream” pollution encouraged by higher disposal costs. \nIn aggregate, the regulations are expensive: about $5.8 billion, or around $2 billion per cancer case reduced. On a per household basis, this works out to an annual cost of $4.10 in increased garbage bills over the twenty-year life of a landfill. \n\n\nUsing the concept of social welfare represented respectively by equations (1) and (3),\n\\[\n\\begin{align}\nSW &= U_{1}\\left(\\, X_{1},\\, P_{1} \\,\\right) \\,+\\, U_{2}\\left(\\, X_{2},\\, P_{2} \\,\\right) \\,+\\, \\cdots\\quad &(1)\\\\\nSW &= U_{1}\\left(\\, X_{1},\\, w\\times P_{1} \\,\\right) \\,+\\, U_{2}\\left(\\, X_{2},\\, P_{2} \\,\\right) \\,+\\, \\cdots\\quad &(3)\n\\end{align}\n\\] explain why the EPA’s landfill regulation is (a) too strict and (b) not strict enough."

    "text": "Market Equilibrium: In a competitive equilibrium, supply equals demand in every market, and every agent maximizes their utility or profit given market prices. In this state, no one has an incentive to change their behavior, as they are already optimizing given the current prices and allocations.\nSocial planner: Let us assume the existence of a benevolent social planner who makes all the decisions in the economy. The social planner is benevolent because the social planner’s objective is to maximize the social welfare by allocating available resources in the economy. While prices coordinate exchanges between agents in the competitive markets, the social planner does not follow prices when allocating resources.\nGovernment: Government’s objective is the same as the social planner’s one—maximizing the social welfare. Unlike the social planner, however, government cannot freely allocate available resources in the economy. Instead, government uses policy tools, such as taxes and subsidies, to achieve the socially optimal allocation of resources given the agents’ optimizing behaviors.\n\n\n\nConsider a society with just two consumers. Consumer 1 can get positive utility from a positive amount of some activity \\(h\\) that she chooses the level of, but consumer 2 gets negative utility from that activity. We can think of \\(h\\) as some non-market good, for example, “hours” of loud music played by consumer 1, disturbing consumer 2’s peace and quiet. Consumer 1 therefore imposes a negative externality on consumer 2. Assume there is no other cost associated with the activity.\nAssume that both consumers gain utilities from consuming a numeraire good \\(x\\), whose price is 1, but may have different incomes \\(Y_{1}\\) and \\(Y_{2}\\).\n\nConsumer 1’s utility is \\(U_{1} = u_{1}(x_{1}, h)\\);\nConsumer 2’s utility is \\(U_{2} = u_{2}(x_{2}, h)\\).\n\n\n\n\nEach consumer’s object is to maximize his/her own utility subject to his/her budget constraint.\n\n\n\n\n\nSocial planner maximizes social welfare subject to resource constraint.\n\n\n\n\n\nEach consumer’s object is to maximize his/her own utility subject to his/her budget constraint.\nGovernment’s object is to maximize social welfare subject to its budget constraint for its policy tools, consumers’ budget constraints, and consumers’ optimizing behaviors."

However, World Bank still considers China a middle-income country, because of its relatively low level of GDP per capita."

It is a benchmark that the government wants to achieve by implementing public policy.\n\nThe socially optimal level of \\(h^{os}\\) alongside the socially optimal levels of \\(x_{1}^{os}\\) and \\(x_{2}^{os}\\) maximizes \\(SW^{os} = SW(x_{1}^{os},x_{2}^{os},h^{os})\\).\nThe Social Planner solves problem (SP-1) subject to resource constraint (RC):\n\\[\n\\begin{align}\n\\max_{x_{1}, x_{2}, h} \\;&SW = x_{1} + x_{2} + h(4-h) - \\omega^{2} h^{2}\\tag{SP-1}\\\\\n\\text{subject to}\\quad &Y_{1} + Y_{2} = x_{1} + x_{2}\\tag{RC}\n\\end{align}\n\\]\nSubstituting \\(x_{1} + x_{2}\\) in the \\(SW\\) using (RC) gives:\n\\[\n\\begin{align}\n\\max_{h} \\;SW &= Y_{1} + Y_{2} + h(4-h) - \\omega^{2}h^{2}\\tag{SP-2}\n\\end{align}\n\\]\nfirst-order condition for problem (SP-2) is\n\\[\n\\frac{d SW}{d h} = 4 - 2h - 2\\omega^{2}h = 0\n\\] Therefore, \\(h^{os} = \\frac{2}{1+\\omega^{2}}\\) and \\(\\{(x_{1}^{os}, x_{2}^{os}): Y_{1} + Y_{2} = x_{1}^{os} + x_{2}^{os}\\}\\).\n\n\nPlot graphs in \\((h, \\$)\\) space, both total and average/marginal, to illustrate the solution.\n\nAnswer:\n\nFor drawing graphs, let \\(\\omega = 2\\) without loss of generality.\nDividing \\(SW(h)\\) into benefit ( \\(B(h) = h(4-h)\\) ) and cost ( \\(C(h) = \\omega^{2} h^{2}\\) ) is useful:\n\n\\[\nSW(h) = B(h) - C(h).\n\\] Here we disregard numeraire goods and incomes.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAt \\(h = h^{os} = 0.4\\), where \\(MB(h^{os}) = MC(h^{os})\\), \\(SW(h^{os})\\) is maximized.\n\n\n\n\n\nDerive the market level \\(h^{*}\\) of the activity that results if choosing it is left up to consumer 1, and show that this level differs from \\(h^{os}\\).\n\nAnswer:\nSame as Q1b in HW 1.\n\n\nAdd \\(h^{*}\\) to your graphs.\n\nAnswer:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSuppose now that the government intervenes in the situation by imposing a tax on \\(h\\).\n\nHere is what happens with the tax revenue:\n\nGovernment forces consumer 1 to pay a per-unit tax \\(t\\) on \\(h\\), and to distribute the tax revenue \\(th\\) in some “lump-sum” fashion across both consumers, giving \\(L_{1}\\) to consumer 1 and \\(L_{2}\\) to consumer 2.\n\nDerive the optimal level of the tax—the level that will induce consumer 1 to choose \\(h^{os}\\) rather than \\(h^{*}\\).\n\nAssume that the government anticipates consumer 1’s response to the tax.\n\n\nAnswer:\nWhen designing an optimal tax scheme to maximize the social welfare, government should anticipate how consumers would respond to tax. This consumer’s behavior is characterized by the first-order conditions in consumers’ utility maximization problems. To derive the optimal level of the tax, we therefore should consider each consumer’s maximization problem before determining the optimal tax.\n\nGiven tax \\(t\\) and lump-sum windfall \\(L_{1}\\), consumer 1 solves problem (C-1-cons-t) subject to budget constraint (BC-1-t):\n\\[\n\\begin{align}\n\\max_{x_{1}, h} \\;&U_{1} = x_{1} + h(4-h) \\tag{C-1-cons-t}\\\\\n\\text{subject to} \\quad &Y_{1} + L_{1} = x_{1} + th \\tag{BC-1-t}\n\\end{align}\n\\]\nSubstituting \\(x_{1}\\) in the \\(U_{1}\\) using (BC-1-t) gives:\n\\[\n\\begin{align}\n\\max_{h} \\;U_{1} &= Y_{1} + L_{1} - th + h(4-h) \\tag{C-1-uncons-t}\n\\end{align}\n\\]\nFirst-order condition for problem (C-1-uncons-t) is\n\\[\n\\frac{d U_{1}}{d h} = 4 - 2h - t = 0\\tag{FOC-C-1-h-t}\n\\] Therefore, \\(h^{**} = 2 - \\frac{t}{2}\\) and \\(x_{1}^{**} = Y_{1} + L_{1} - t(2 - \\frac{t}{2})\\).\n\nGiven lump-sum windfall \\(L_{2}\\), consumer 2 solves problem (C-2-cons-t) subject to budget constraint (BC-2-t):\n\\[\n\\begin{align}\n\\max_{x_{2}} \\;&U_{2} =  x_{2} - h^{2} \\tag{C-2-cons-t}\\\\\n\\text{subject to}\\quad &Y_{2} + L_{2} = x_{2} \\tag{BC-2-t}\n\\end{align}\n\\]\nSubstituting \\(x_{2}\\) in the \\(U_{2}\\) using (BC-2-t) gives \\(x_{2}^{**} = Y_{2} + L_{2}\\)\n\nTaking into account how consumer 1 and consumer 2 behave, government solves problem (G-t) subject to government’s budget constraint (BC-G-t):\n\\[\n\\begin{align}\n\\max_{x_{1}, x_{2}, h, t, L_{1}, L_{2}} \\;&SW = x_{1} + x_{2} + h(4-h) - \\omega^{2}h^{2}\\tag{G-t}\\\\\n\\text{subject to}\\quad &Y_{1} + L_{1} = x_{1} + t h\\tag{BC-1-t}\\\\\n&Y_{2} + L_{2} = x_{2} \\tag{BC-2-t}\\\\\n&L_{1} + L_{2} = th \\tag{BC-G-t}\\\\\n&\\!\\!\\!\\!\\!\\!4 - 2h - t = 0\\tag{FOC-C-1-h-t}\n\\end{align}\n\\] Substituting in (BC-1-t) and (BC-2-t) to eliminate \\(x_{1}\\) and \\(x_{2}\\) simplifies the problem (G-t) to\n\\[\n\\begin{align}\n\\max_{h, t, L_{1}, L_{2}} \\;&SW = Y_{1} + Y_{2} + L_{1} + L_{2} - th\\\\&\\qquad\\quad + h(4-h) - \\omega^{2}h^{2}\\tag{G-t-v2}\\\\\n\\text{subject to}\\quad &L_{1} + L_{2} = th \\tag{BC-G-t}\\\\\n&\\!\\!\\!\\!\\!\\!4 - 2h - t = 0\\tag{FOC-C-1-h-t}\n\\end{align}\n\\]\nSubstituting in (BC-G-t) to eliminate \\(L_{1}\\) and \\(L_{2}\\) simplifies the problem (G-t-v2) to\n\\[\n\\begin{align}\n\\max_{h, t} \\;&SW = Y_{1} + Y_{2} + h(4-h) - \\omega^{2}h^{2}\\tag{G-t-v3}\\\\\n\\text{subject to}\\quad &4 - 2h - t = 0\\tag{FOC-C-1-h-t}\n\\end{align}\n\\]\nLagrangian function for problem (G-t-v3) is\n\\[\n\\mathcal{L} = Y_{1} + Y_{2} + h(4-h) - \\omega^{2}h^{2} -\\lambda(4 - 2h - t)\\tag{G-t-L}\n\\] First-order conditions for problem (G-t-L) are\n\\[\n\\begin{align}\n\\frac{d \\mathcal{L}}{d h} &= 4 - 2h - 2\\omega^{2}h + 2\\lambda  = 0 \\tag{FOC-G-h}\\\\\n\\frac{d \\mathcal{L}}{d t} &= \\lambda = 0 \\tag{FOC-G-t}\\\\\n\\frac{d \\mathcal{L}}{d \\lambda} &= 4 - 2h - t = 0 \\tag{FOC-G-$\\lambda$}\\\\\n\\end{align}\n\\]\nTherefore, \\(h^{**} = \\frac{2}{1+\\omega^{2}} = h^{os}\\) and \\(t^{**} = \\frac{4\\omega^{2}}{1+\\omega^{2}}\\).

Is it more efficient to rent the machine or relocate Groucho to another room?\n\nAnswer:\nWe know that with machine rental, 4 cigars will be reduced.\nSuppose Groucho has the right to smoke, and so the status quo has him smoking 12 a day. Harpo has three choices:\n\nDo not rent the machine and do not relocate Groucho, but pay Groucho not to smoke.\nRent the machine and then pay Groucho not to smoke.\nPay to relocate Groucho.\n\nWhich would Harpo choose?\nNot renting the machine requires Harpo to compensate Groucho for the MC of reducing cigars: \\(1+2+3+4+5+6= \\$21\\) in costs. Harpo’s benefits are \\(12+11+10+9+8+7=\\$57\\), so net benefits are \\(57-21=\\$36\\).\nMachine rental costs \\(\\$10\\), plus Harpo has to pay Groucho at least his MC of reduction for the first four cigarettes. The costs of machine rental are thus: \\(10+1+2+3+4=\\$20\\). Relative to the status quo of 12 cigars smoked, the benefits of machine rental have two components. First, Harpo gets the full benefits of seeing 4 cigarettes reduced: \\(12+11+10+9=\\$42\\). Second, she gets the 50% improvement in air quality for the remaining 8 cigars that are smoked: \\(4+3.5+3+2.5+2+1.5+1+.5=\\$18\\). So, net benefits are \\(42+18-20= \\$40\\).\nFinally, relocation costs \\(\\$40\\), and brings Harpo the total area under the MB curve in benefits. (Since Groucho can smoke all he wants after relocation, he bears no costs). Therefore, the net benefits to Harpo of paying for relocation are: \\((12+11+10+9+8+7+6+5+4+3+2+1)-40 =\\$38\\).\nTherefore, the efficient choice is the option 2."

If Groucho rents the machine, he would pay the following costs: \\(\\$10\\) for machine rental, plus \\(1+2+3+4=\\$10\\) in nicotine withdrawals on 4 cigars given up, plus \\(4+3.5+3+2.5+2+1.5+1+.5=\\$18\\) in bribes to Harpo to allow him to smoke \\(8\\) cigarettes.

    "text": "Consider a society with just two consumers. Consumer 1 can get positive utility from a positive amount of some activity \\(h\\) that she chooses the level of, but consumer 2 gets negative utility from that activity. We can think of \\(h\\) as some non-market good, for example, “hours” of loud music played by consumer 1, disturbing consumer 2’s peace and quiet. Consumer 1 therefore imposes a negative externality on consumer 2.

In Classwork 4, we discussed what the Social Planner does:\n\nSocial planner maximizes social welfare subject to resource constraint.\n\nThe Social Planner’s problem refers to a scenario where a central authority (the Social Planner) seeks to allocate resources in a way that maximizes social welfare, subject to available resources, which is described by the resource constraint.\nThe optimal allocation of resources obtained from the Social Planner’s problem plays an important role in making public policy work. It is a benchmark that the government wants to achieve by implementing public policy.\n\nThe socially optimal level of \\(h^{o}\\) alongside the socially optimal levels of \\(x_{1}^{o}\\) and \\(x_{2}^{o}\\) maximizes \\(SW^{o} = SW(x_{1}^{o},x_{2}^{o},h^{o})\\).\nThe Social Planner solves problem (SP-1) subject to resource constraint (RC):\n\\[\n\\begin{align}\n\\max_{x_{1}, x_{2}, h} \\;&SW = x_{1} + x_{2} + h(4-h) - h^{2}\\tag{SP-1}\\\\\n\\text{subject to}\\quad &Y_{1} + Y_{2} = x_{1} + x_{2}\\tag{RC}\n\\end{align}\n\\]\nSubstituting \\(x_{1} + x_{2}\\) in the \\(SW\\) using (RC) gives:\n\\[\n\\begin{align}\n\\max_{h} \\;SW &= Y_{1} + Y_{2} + h(4-h) - h^{2}\\tag{SP-2}\n\\end{align}\n\\]\nfirst-order condition for problem (SP-2) is\n\\[\n\\frac{d SW}{d h} = 4 - 4h = 0\n\\] Therefore, \\(h^{o} = 1\\) and \\(\\{(x_{1}^{o}, x_{2}^{o}): Y_{1} + Y_{2} = x_{1}^{o} + x_{2}^{o}\\}\\).\n\n\nPlot graphs in \\((h, \\$)\\) space, both total and average/marginal, to illustrate the solution.\n\nAnswer:\n\nDividing \\(SW(h)\\) into benefit ( \\(B(h) = h(4-h)\\) ) and cost ( \\(C(h) = h^{2}\\) ) is useful:\n\n\\[\nSW(h) = B(h) - C(h).\n\\] Here we disregard numeraire goods and incomes.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAt \\(h = h^{o} = 1\\), where \\(MB(h^{o}) = MC(h^{o})\\), \\(SW(h^{o})\\) is maximized.\n\n\n\n\n\nDerive the market level \\(h^{*}\\) of the activity that results if choosing it is left up to consumer 1, and show that this level differs from \\(h^{o}\\).\n\nAnswer:\nIn the market, each single economic agent maximizes his/her own utility.\n\nConsumer 1 solves problem (C-1-cons) subject to budget constraint (BC-1):\n\\[\n\\begin{align}\n\\max_{x_{1}, h} \\;&U_{1} = x_{1} + h(4-h) \\tag{C-1-cons}\\\\\n\\text{subject to}\\quad &Y_{1} = x_{1} \\tag{BC-1}\n\\end{align}\n\\]\nSubstituting \\(x_{1}\\) in the \\(U_{1}\\) using (BC-1) gives \\(x_{1}^{*} = Y_{1}\\) and:\n\\[\n\\begin{align}\n\\max_{h} \\;U_{1} &= Y_{1} + h(4-h) \\tag{C-1-uncons}\n\\end{align}\n\\]\nfirst-order condition for problem (C-1-uncons) is\n\\[\n\\frac{d U_{1}}{d h} = 4 - 2h = 0\n\\] Therefore, \\(h^{*} = 2\\).\n\nConsumer 2 solves problem (C-2-cons) subject to budget constraint (BC-2):\n\\[\n\\begin{align}\n\\max_{x_{2}} \\;&U_{2} = x_{2} - h^{2} \\tag{C-2-cons}\\\\\n\\text{subject to}\\quad &Y_{2} = x_{2} \\tag{BC-2}\n\\end{align}\n\\]\nSubstituting \\(x_{2}\\) in the \\(U_{2}\\) using (BC-2) gives \\(x_{2}^{*} = Y_{2}\\).\n\n\nAdd \\(h^{*}\\) to your graphs.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAt \\(h = h^{*} = 2\\), where \\(MB(h^{*}) = 0\\), consumer 1’s benefit \\(B(h^{*}) = h^{*}(4-h^{*})\\) is maximized.\n\nWhen \\(h < 2\\), consumer 1 has incentive to increase \\(h\\), as the marginal benefit of \\(h\\) is positive.\nWhen \\(h > 2\\), consumer 1 has incentive to decrease \\(h\\), as the marginal benefit of \\(h\\) is negative.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSuppose now that the government intervenes in the situation by imposing a tax on \\(h\\).\n\nHere is what happens with the tax revenue:\n\nGovernment forces consumer 1 to pay a per-unit tax \\(t\\) on \\(h\\), and to distribute the tax revenue \\(th\\) in some “lump-sum” fashion across both consumers, giving \\(L_{1}\\) to consumer 1 and \\(L_{2}\\) to consumer 2.\n\nDerive the optimal level of the tax—the level that will induce consumer 1 to choose \\(h^{o}\\) rather than \\(h^{*}\\).\n\nAssume that the government anticipates consumer 1’s response to the tax.\n\n\nAnswer:\nWhen designing an optimal tax scheme to maximize the social welfare, government should anticipate how consumers would respond to tax. This consumer’s behavior is characterized by the first-order conditions in consumers’ utility maximization problems. To derive the optimal level of the tax, we therefore should consider each consumer’s maximization problem before determining the optimal tax.\n\nGiven tax \\(t\\) and lump-sum windfall \\(L_{1}\\), consumer 1 solves problem (C-1-cons-t) subject to budget constraint (BC-1-t):\n\\[\n\\begin{align}\n\\max_{x_{1}, h} \\;&U_{1} = x_{1} + h(4-h) \\tag{C-1-cons-t}\\\\\n\\text{subject to} \\quad &Y_{1} + L_{1} = x_{1} + th \\tag{BC-1-t}\n\\end{align}\n\\]\nSubstituting \\(x_{1}\\) in the \\(U_{1}\\) using (BC-1-t) gives:\n\\[\n\\begin{align}\n\\max_{h} \\;U_{1} &= Y_{1} + L_{1} - th + h(4-h) \\tag{C-1-uncons-t}\n\\end{align}\n\\]\nFirst-order condition for problem (C-1-uncons-t) is\n\\[\n\\frac{d U_{1}}{d h} = 4 - 2h - t = 0\\tag{FOC-C-1-h-t}\n\\] Therefore, \\(h^{**} = 2 - \\frac{t}{2}\\) and \\(x_{1}^{**} = Y_{1} + L_{1} - t(2 - \\frac{t}{2})\\).\n\nGiven lump-sum windfall \\(L_{2}\\), consumer 2 solves problem (C-2-cons-t) subject to budget constraint (BC-2-t):\n\\[\n\\begin{align}\n\\max_{x_{2}} \\;&U_{2} =  x_{2} - h^{2} \\tag{C-2-cons-t}\\\\\n\\text{subject to}\\quad &Y_{2} + L_{2} = x_{2} \\tag{BC-2-t}\n\\end{align}\n\\]\nSubstituting \\(x_{2}\\) in the \\(U_{2}\\) using (BC-2-t) gives \\(x_{2}^{**} = Y_{2} + L_{2}\\)\n\nTaking into account how consumer 1 and consumer 2 behave, government solves problem (G-t) subject to government’s budget constraint (BC-G-t):\n\\[\n\\begin{align}\n\\max_{x_{1}, x_{2}, h, t, L_{1}, L_{2}} \\;&SW = x_{1} + x_{2} + h(4-h) - h^{2}\\tag{G-t}\\\\\n\\text{subject to}\\quad &Y_{1} + L_{1} = x_{1} + t h\\tag{BC-1-t}\\\\\n&Y_{2} + L_{2} = x_{2} \\tag{BC-2-t}\\\\\n&L_{1} + L_{2} = th \\tag{BC-G-t}\\\\\n&\\!\\!\\!\\!\\!\\!4 - 2h - t = 0\\tag{FOC-C-1-h-t}\n\\end{align}\n\\] Substituting in (BC-1-t) and (BC-2-t) to eliminate \\(x_{1}\\) and \\(x_{2}\\) simplifies the problem (G-t) to\n\\[\n\\begin{align}\n\\max_{h, t, L_{1}, L_{2}} \\;&SW = Y_{1} + Y_{2} + L_{1} + L_{2} - th\\\\&\\qquad\\quad + h(4-h) - h^{2}\\tag{G-t-v2}\\\\\n\\text{subject to}\\quad &L_{1} + L_{2} = th \\tag{BC-G-t}\\\\\n&\\!\\!\\!\\!\\!\\!4 - 2h - t = 0\\tag{FOC-C-1-h-t}\n\\end{align}\n\\]\nSubstituting in (BC-G-t) to eliminate \\(L_{1}\\) and \\(L_{2}\\) simplifies the problem (G-t-v2) to\n\\[\n\\begin{align}\n\\max_{h, t} \\;&SW = Y_{1} + Y_{2} + h(4-h) - h^{2}\\tag{G-t-v3}\\\\\n\\text{subject to}\\quad &4 - 2h - t = 0\\tag{FOC-C-1-h-t}\n\\end{align}\n\\]\nLagrangian function for problem (G-t-v3) is\n\\[\n\\mathcal{L} = Y_{1} + Y_{2} + h(4-h) - h^{2} -\\lambda(4 - 2h - t)\\tag{G-t-L}\n\\] first-order conditions for problem (G-t-L) are\n\\[\n\\begin{align}\n\\frac{d \\mathcal{L}}{d h} &= 4 - 4h + 2\\lambda  = 0 \\tag{FOC-G-h}\\\\\n\\frac{d \\mathcal{L}}{d t} &= \\lambda = 0 \\tag{FOC-G-t}\\\\\n\\frac{d \\mathcal{L}}{d \\lambda} &= 4 - 2h - t = 0 \\tag{FOC-G-$\\lambda$}\\\\\n\\end{align}\n\\]\nTherefore, \\(t^{**} = 2\\) and \\(h^{**} = 1 = h^{o}\\).

    "text": "I view myself as an applied economist with interest in environmental economics and a particular focus on climate change. Methodologically, I make use of causal inference/econometrics/machine learning methods, and other data science tools to conduct empirical analysis. I also use computational methods to solve integrated assessment models of climate change and theoretical economic models, such as dynamic contracts.\nMy research focuses on how to improve effectiveness of climate policy at both micro and macro levels. In particular, I am interested in building relevant climate-economy models that analyze the interaction between economies and the climate under risks arising from (1) climate change and (2) a transition to carbon-neutral economies.\nAs an economics and data science teacher, my goal is to equip students with the essential tools of machine learning, econometrics, and data science to think critically about business and real-world socioeconomic issues. In this regard, I teach students to use those tools to address important business strategies, socioeconomic issues, and individual decision-making."

Our aim is to examine how governance qualities in developing countries impact financial contributions from contributor countries that intend to fund mitigation projects in the energy sector. We have compiled a dataset of yearly climate finance contributions at the project level spanning from 2011 to 2019. Our analysis, which utilizes random forests and LASSO estimations, reveals that climate finance contributions, particularly those for energy-related projects, are significantly linked to good governance, including a robust legal system, rule of law, and accountability. Ultimately, this study provides valuable insights into the dynamics between governance and climate finance in developing countries and informs policy decisions to support effective climate action in the energy sector. (One of the chapters in the book, \"Climate Finance: Supporting a Sustainable Energy Transition,\" Springer Nature. 2024). \n  \n  \n     \n    Social Media Campaigns, Lobbying and Legislation: Evidence from #climatechange/#globalwarming and Energy Lobbies    Abstract : To what extent do social media campaigns compete with fossil fuel lobbying on climate change legislation? In this article, I estimate the effect of social media campaigns on a congressperson's legislative activities against climate change actions during the U.S. Congresses (January 2013-January 2019). I find that (1) a 1% increase in the per-capita level of activities of climate change campaigns using Twitter decreases Democrats' tendency to support climate-unfriendly legislation by 0.9%, while it increases Republicans' one by 0.2%; and (2) a 1% increase in the fossil fuel industry's lobbying expenditure relative to the rest of industries' lobbying expenditure increases Republicans' tendency to support climate-unfriendly legislation by 1.1%. I also find that negative sentiment in social media campaigns contributes to affecting congresspersons' support for climate-unfriendly legislation. \n  \n  \n     \n    Climate Finance under Conflicts and Renegotiations: A Dynamic Contract Approach  (AEA 2019 poster)     Abstract : Considering climate funds (e.g. the Green Climate Fund) as the financial mechanism to provide funding to developing countries, this paper examines a long-term climate funding relationship between two agents---the rich country and the poor country. Conflicts between the rich and poor countries arise when determining 1) the size of climate funding that the rich country contributes to the poor country, and 2) the funding allocation between climate adaptation and mitigation projects in the poor country. In addition, the rich country cannot be forced to commit contractual contributions to the poor country, and the climate funding relationship can be repeatedly renegotiated. This paper derives the following results: (1) climate funds converge to the first-best in the long-run, in terms of the size of climate funding and its balance between adaptation and mitigation projects, if and only if climate damage becomes sufficiently severe. (2) funding allocation between adaptation and mitigation projects becomes more favorable to the poor country if marginal climate costs in the poor country grow faster than in the rich country. (3) fewer conflicts and fewer renegotiations between the rich and poor countries make climate funding contracts more efficient, remedying inequality between the poor and rich countries."

In other words, even though a giver will never meet the corresponding receiver, he cares enough about how he could be perceived by others to lie (i.e., second-order beliefs enters his utility function). In our experiment we provide givers with the opportunity to lie about the size of the endowment without using their giving. Similar to Ockenfels and Werner (2012) we find that (i) few take the opportunity to lie---but those who do give less when their giving is not constrained by its role as a signal---and (ii) givers are more likely to lie when the lie is private. However, using a second stage in the experimental design, we show that liars are the most responsive group of givers to a simple message stating the expectation of the receiver."
