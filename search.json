Consumer 1 can get positive utility from a positive amount of some activity \\(h\\) that she chooses the level of, but consumer 2 gets negative utility from that activity. We can think of \\(h\\) as some non-market good, for example, “hours” of loud music played by consumer 1, disturbing consumer 2’s peace and quiet. Consumer 1 therefore imposes a negative externality on consumer 2. Assume there is no other cost associated with the activity.\nAssume that both consumers gain utilities from consuming a numeraire good \\(x\\), whose price is 1, but may have different incomes \\(Y_{1}\\) and \\(Y_{2}\\).\n\nConsumer 1’s utility is \\(U_{1} = x_{1} + h(4-h)\\).\nConsumer 2’s utility is \\(U_{2} = x_{2} - h^{2}\\).\n\n\n\n\n\nSuppose that, instead of a tax or a subsidy, the government introduces a marketable-permit scheme.\n\nIt gives consumer 2 a bunch of pieces of paper called “permits,” each of which states that the holder of the permit has the legal right to “produce” one unit of \\(h\\).\nIt then allows consumer 2 to sell those permits to consumer 1 at some uniform price \\(p_{h}\\).\n\nAssume that the permit market is competitive.\n\nThis means that each consumer takes the price \\(p_{h}\\) as given.\nYou can think of each consumer as “representing” a large number of consumers of the same type.\n\nShow that the scheme will also achieve the socially optimal outcome \\(h^{o}\\).\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSame question as Q1e, but now the government introduces a marketable-permit scheme that gives a bunch of permits to consumer 1, and then gives consumer 2 an opportunity to buy them away from consumer 1 and “retire” them.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSuppose that, instead of trying to intervene in the market, the government just passes a law giving consumer 2 a clearly defined right to have \\(h = 0\\) (e.g., it imposes a noise ordinance that forbids consumer 1 from playing loud music), but then allows consumer 1 to effectively “bribe” consumer 2 to give up some of that right (i.e., allow some music playing) in exchange for a lump-sum transfer \\(T\\).\nShow that this, too, will restore social optimality.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSame question as Q1g, but now the government gives consumer 1 a clear legal right to \\(h^{*}\\) (i.e., in our example, a right to play as much loud music as she likes), and then allows consumer 2 to effectively “bribe” consumer 1 to give up some of that right (i.e., cut back on her music playing) in exchange for a lump-sum transfer \\(T\\)."

    "text": "The Public Goods Game is a standard of experimental economics used primarily to study the free-rider problem and cooperation among individuals. In this game, participants are given a sum of money and are offered the opportunity to contribute some or all of it to a public pot. The money in this pot is then multiplied by a factor greater than one but less than the number of players, and the resulting amount is distributed equally among all players, regardless of their individual contributions.\n\n\n\nInitial Endowment: Each player starts with an initial amount of money (e.g., $10).\nContribution: Players decide how much of their initial endowment to contribute to a public pot. They can contribute nothing, everything, or anything in between.\nMultiplication: The total amount in the public pot is multiplied by a factor (e.g., 1.5).\nDistribution: The multiplied amount is then equally distributed among all players, irrespective of their individual contributions.\n\n\n\n\nLet’s consider a simple example with four players, each initially endowed with $10. They have to decide how much to contribute to a public pot.\n\nPlayer A contributes $8\nPlayer B contributes $6\nPlayer C contributes $0 (free-rider)\nPlayer D contributes $4\n\nThe total amount in the public pot is (8 + 6 + 0 + 4 = $18).\nThis amount is then multiplied by a factor, say 1.5, resulting in (18 = $27).\nFinally, the $27 is distributed equally among the four players, giving each (27 / 4 = $6.75).\n\n\n\n\nPlayer A: Started with $10, contributed $8, received $6.75. Final amount: (10 - 8 + 6.75 = $8.75)\nPlayer B: Started with $10, contributed $6, received $6.75. Final amount: (10 - 6 + 6.75 = $10.75)\nPlayer C: Started with $10, contributed $0, received $6.75. Final amount: (10 - 0 + 6.75 = $16.75) (benefited most by free-riding)\nPlayer D: Started with $10, contributed $4, received $6.75. Final amount: (10 - 4 + 6.75 = $12.75)\n\n\n\n\n\nFree-Rider Problem: Players like C who contribute nothing still receive a share of the public good, illustrating the free-rider problem.\nIncentive to Defect: Rational, self-interested players have an incentive to contribute nothing and free-ride on the contributions of others.\nCollective Action Problem: If everyone acts in their self-interest, the public good is under-provided, leading to suboptimal outcomes for the group.\nCooperation and Norms: In many real-world experiments, some level of contribution is observed, indicating that factors like altruism, social norms, or the prospect of future interactions can promote cooperation.\n\nThe Public Goods Game is a powerful tool for studying the complexities of cooperation and the provision of public goods, offering insights into how and why people contribute to collective endeavors."

    "text": "The Cobb-Douglas utility function is\n\\[\n\\begin{align}\nu(x_{1}, x_{2}) = x_{1}^{\\alpha}x_{2}^{\\beta}.\n\\end{align}\n\\] Since utility functions are only defined up to a monotonic transformation, it is convenient to take logs of this expression and work with:\n\\[\n\\begin{align}\n\\log u(x_{1}, x_{2}) = \\alpha \\log x_{1} + \\beta \\log x_{2}.\n\\end{align}\n\\]\n\nBy the way, a monotonic transformation is a way of transforming one set of numbers into another set of numbers in a way that the order of the numbers is preserved.\n\nTherefore, a monotonic transformation of a utility function preserves the order of the utility values.\nIf bundle \\(A\\) is preferred to bundle \\(B\\), then a monotonic transformation of the utility function will still show that \\(A\\) is preferred to \\(B\\).\n\n\nLet’s find the demand functions for \\(x_1\\) and \\(x_2\\) for the Cobb-Douglas utility function. The problem we want to solve is\n\\[\n\\begin{align}\n\\max_{x_{1}, x_{2}}&\\; \\log u(x_{1}, x_{2}) = \\alpha \\log x_{1} + \\beta \\log x_{2} \\tag{1}\\\\\n\\text{such that}&\\quad Y \\;\\geq\\; p_{1}x_{1} + p_{2}x_{2} \\tag{2}\n\\end{align}\n\\]\nThere are at least two ways to solve this problem.\n\n\nSince “the more, the better” holds for this consumer, the budget constraint holds with equality at the optimum. Using this fact, we can then substitute out \\(x_{2}\\) in problem (1) using the budget constraint (2) with equality.\n\\[\n\\begin{align}\n\\max_{x_{1}}&\\; \\log u(x_{1}) = \\alpha \\log x_{1} + \\beta \\log \\left(\\frac{Y - p_{1}x_{1}}{p_{2}}\\right) \\tag{3}\n\\end{align}\n\\] The first order condition for problem (3) is\n\\[\n\\begin{align}\n\\frac{\\alpha}{x_{1}} + \\frac{\\beta}{\\left(\\frac{Y - p_{1}x_{1}}{p_{2}}\\right)}\\left(-\\frac{p_{1}}{p_{2}}\\right) \\,=\\, 0.  \\tag{4}\n\\end{align}\n\\] Re-arranging the first-order condition (4) and the budget constraint (2) with equality gives the demand for \\(x_{1}\\) and \\(x_{2}\\):\n\\[\n\\begin{align}\nx_{1}^{*} = \\frac{\\alpha}{\\alpha + \\beta} \\frac{Y}{p_{1}},\\\\\nx_{2}^{*} = \\frac{\\beta}{\\alpha + \\beta} \\frac{Y}{p_{2}}.\n\\end{align}\n\\]\n\n\n\nNow for Lagrange’s method for the problem (1) with constraint (2). Set up the Lagrangian: \\[\n\\mathcal{L} = \\alpha\\log x_{1} + \\beta\\log x_{2} + \\lambda(Y - p_{1}x_{1} - p_{2}x_{2}). \\tag{5}\n\\] Differentiate (5) with respect to each of the choice variables, \\(x_{1}, x_{2}\\), and \\(\\lambda\\) to get the three first-order conditions:\n\\[\n\\begin{align}\n\\frac{\\partial\\mathcal{L}}{\\partial x_{1}} &= \\frac{\\alpha}{x_{1}} - \\lambda p_{1} = 0, \\tag{6}\\\\\n\\frac{\\partial\\mathcal{L}}{\\partial x_{2}} &= \\frac{\\beta}{x_{2}} - \\lambda p_{2} = 0, \\tag{7}\\\\\n\\frac{\\partial\\mathcal{L}}{\\partial x_{1}} &= Y - p_{1}x_{1} - p_{2}x_{2} = 0. \\tag{8}\\\\\n\\end{align}\n\\] Now we are to solve the system of equations—three unknowns (\\(x_{1}, x_{2}\\), and \\(\\lambda\\)), three equations (6), (7), and (8).\nRearranging (6) and (7) gives: \\[\n\\begin{align}\nx_{1} = \\frac{\\alpha}{\\lambda p_{1}},\\tag{8}\\\\\nx_{2} = \\frac{\\beta}{\\lambda p_{2}}.\\tag{9}\n\\end{align}\n\\]\nNow we need to find \\(\\lambda\\).\nRearranging (6) and (7) also gives: \\[\n\\begin{align}\n\\alpha  &= \\lambda p_{1}x_{1},\\\\\n\\beta  &= \\lambda p_{2}x_{2}.\n\\end{align}\n\\] Adding the equations above gives:\n\\[\n\\alpha + \\beta = \\lambda(p_{1}x_{1} + p_{2}x_{2}) = \\lambda Y,\n\\] which gives us\n\\[\n\\lambda = \\frac{\\alpha + \\beta}{Y}.\\tag{10}\n\\]\nSubstitute (10) back into (8) and (9) and solve for \\(x_{1}\\) and \\(x_{2}\\) to get\n\\[\n\\begin{align}\nx_{1}^{*} = \\frac{\\alpha}{\\alpha + \\beta} \\frac{Y}{p_{1}},\\\\\nx_{2}^{*} = \\frac{\\beta}{\\alpha + \\beta} \\frac{Y}{p_{2}},\n\\end{align}\n\\]\njust as before."

    "text": "Recently, the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency issued regulations covering the design and construction of landfills for municipal solid waste. Landfills can represent a threat to environmental health if toxic chemicals leach from the waste into surrounding ground or surface waters. \nThe regulations require certain design, construction and maintenance standards extending beyond the post-closure period, including, in most cases, installation of impermeable liners and covers and groundwater monitoring. The purpose of the regulations was to ensure safe containment of solid waste and to prevent future generations from having to bear clean-up costs from poorly-disposed waste. \nEven with the new regulations, just under 10% of landfills will still pose what the EPA considers to be a “moderate” health risk for individuals who depend on contaminated groundwater: a greater than 1 in 1,000,000 increase in the risk of contracting cancer. However, because so few people actually depend on ground water within leaching distance of a landfill, the new regulations were predicted to reduce cancer by only 2 or 3 cases over the next 300 years. Potential benefits of the regulation not quantified by the EPA include: increased ease of siting landfills, reduced damage to surface water, fairness to future generations and an overall reduction in waste generation and related “upstream” pollution encouraged by higher disposal costs. \nIn aggregate, the regulations are expensive: about $5.8 billion, or around $2 billion per cancer case reduced. On a per household basis, this works out to an annual cost of $4.10 in increased garbage bills over the twenty-year life of a landfill. \n\n\nUsing the concept of social welfare represented respectively by equations (1) and (3),\n\\[\n\\begin{align}\nSW &= U_{1}\\left(\\, X_{1},\\, P_{1} \\,\\right) \\,+\\, U_{2}\\left(\\, X_{2},\\, P_{2} \\,\\right) \\,+\\, \\cdots\\quad &(1)\\\\\nSW &= U_{1}\\left(\\, X_{1},\\, w\\times P_{1} \\,\\right) \\,+\\, U_{2}\\left(\\, X_{2},\\, P_{2} \\,\\right) \\,+\\, \\cdots\\quad &(3)\n\\end{align}\n\\] explain why the EPA’s landfill regulation is (a) too strict and (b) not strict enough."

In this state, no one has an incentive to change their behavior, as they are already optimizing given the current prices and allocations.\nSocial planner: Let us assume the existence of a benevolent social planner who makes all the decisions in the economy. The social planner is benevolent because the social planner’s objective is to maximize the social welfare by allocating available resources in the economy. While prices coordinate exchanges between agents in the competitive markets, the social planner does not follow prices when allocating resources.\nGovernment: Government’s objective is the same as the social planner’s one—maximizing the social welfare. Unlike the social planner, however, government cannot freely allocate available resources in the economy. Instead, government uses policy tools, such as taxes and subsidies, to achieve the socially optimal allocation of resources given the agents’ optimizing behaviors.\n\n\n\nConsider a society with just two consumers. Consumer 1 can get positive utility from a positive amount of some activity \\(h\\) that she chooses the level of, but consumer 2 gets negative utility from that activity. We can think of \\(h\\) as some non-market good, for example, “hours” of loud music played by consumer 1, disturbing consumer 2’s peace and quiet.

However, World Bank still considers China a middle-income country, because of its relatively low level of GDP per capita."

    "text": "Consider a society with just two consumers. Consumer 1 can get positive utility from a positive amount of some activity \\(h\\) that she chooses the level of, but consumer 2 gets negative utility from that activity. We can think of \\(h\\) as some non-market good, for example, “hours” of loud music played by consumer 1, disturbing consumer 2’s peace and quiet. Consumer 1 therefore imposes a negative externality on consumer 2. Assume there is no other cost associated with the activity.\nAssume that both consumers gain utilities from consuming a numeraire good \\(x\\), whose price is 1, but may have different incomes \\(Y_{1}\\) and \\(Y_{2}\\).\n\nConsumer 1’s utility is \\(U_{1} = x_{1} + h(4-h)\\).\nConsumer 2’s utility is \\(U_{2} = x_{2} - h^{2}\\).\n\n\n\n\n\nUnder the efficiency standard, what is the socially optimal level of \\(h^{o}\\)?\n\nAnswer:\nThe social welfare function is \\[\n\\begin{align}\nSW &= U_{1} + U_{2}\\\\\n&= x_{1} + x_{2} + h(4-h) - h^{2}.\n\\end{align}\n\\] \nTo derive the socially optimal level of \\(h^{o}\\), we should consider the Social Planner’s problem. In Classwork 4, we discussed what the Social Planner does:\n\nSocial planner maximizes social welfare subject to resource constraint.\n\nThe Social Planner’s problem refers to a scenario where a central authority (the Social Planner) seeks to allocate resources in a way that maximizes social welfare, subject to available resources, which is described by the resource constraint.\nThe optimal allocation of resources obtained from the Social Planner’s problem plays an important role in making public policy work. It is a benchmark that the government wants to achieve by implementing public policy.\n\nThe socially optimal level of \\(h^{o}\\) alongside the socially optimal levels of \\(x_{1}^{o}\\) and \\(x_{2}^{o}\\) maximizes \\(SW^{o} = SW(x_{1}^{o},x_{2}^{o},h^{o})\\).\nThe Social Planner solves problem (SP-1) subject to resource constraint (RC):\n\\[\n\\begin{align}\n\\max_{x_{1}, x_{2}, h} \\;&SW = x_{1} + x_{2} + h(4-h) - h^{2}\\tag{SP-1}\\\\\n\\text{subject to}\\quad &Y_{1} + Y_{2} = x_{1} + x_{2}\\tag{RC}\n\\end{align}\n\\]\nSubstituting \\(x_{1} + x_{2}\\) in the \\(SW\\) using (RC) gives:\n\\[\n\\begin{align}\n\\max_{h} \\;SW &= Y_{1} + Y_{2} + h(4-h) - h^{2}\\tag{SP-2}\n\\end{align}\n\\]\nfirst-order condition for problem (SP-2) is\n\\[\n\\frac{d SW}{d h} = 4 - 4h = 0\n\\] Therefore, \\(h^{o} = 1\\) and \\(\\{(x_{1}^{o}, x_{2}^{o}): Y_{1} + Y_{2} = x_{1}^{o} + x_{2}^{o}\\}\\).\n\n\nPlot graphs in \\((h, \\$)\\) space, both total and average/marginal, to illustrate the solution.\n\nAnswer:\n\nDividing \\(SW(h)\\) into benefit ( \\(B(h) = h(4-h)\\) ) and cost ( \\(C(h) = h^{2}\\) ) is useful:\n\n\\[\nSW(h) = B(h) - C(h).\n\\] Here we disregard numeraire goods and incomes.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAt \\(h = h^{o} = 1\\), where \\(MB(h^{o}) = MC(h^{o})\\), \\(SW(h^{o})\\) is maximized.\n\n\n\n\n\nDerive the market level \\(h^{*}\\) of the activity that results if choosing it is left up to consumer 1, and show that this level differs from \\(h^{o}\\).\n\nAnswer:\nIn the market, each single economic agent maximizes his/her own utility.\n\nConsumer 1 solves problem (C-1-cons) subject to budget constraint (BC-1):\n\\[\n\\begin{align}\n\\max_{x_{1}, h} \\;&U_{1} = x_{1} + h(4-h) \\tag{C-1-cons}\\\\\n\\text{subject to}\\quad &Y_{1} = x_{1} \\tag{BC-1}\n\\end{align}\n\\]\nSubstituting \\(x_{1}\\) in the \\(U_{1}\\) using (BC-1) gives \\(x_{1}^{*} = Y_{1}\\) and:\n\\[\n\\begin{align}\n\\max_{h} \\;U_{1} &= Y_{1} + h(4-h) \\tag{C-1-uncons}\n\\end{align}\n\\]\nfirst-order condition for problem (C-1-uncons) is\n\\[\n\\frac{d U_{1}}{d h} = 4 - 2h = 0\n\\] Therefore, \\(h^{*} = 2\\).\n\nConsumer 2 solves problem (C-2-cons) subject to budget constraint (BC-2):\n\\[\n\\begin{align}\n\\max_{x_{2}} \\;&U_{2} = x_{2} - h^{2} \\tag{C-2-cons}\\\\\n\\text{subject to}\\quad &Y_{2} = x_{2} \\tag{BC-2}\n\\end{align}\n\\]\nSubstituting \\(x_{2}\\) in the \\(U_{2}\\) using (BC-2) gives \\(x_{2}^{*} = Y_{2}\\).\n\n\nAdd \\(h^{*}\\) to your graphs.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAt \\(h = h^{*} = 2\\), where \\(MB(h^{*}) = 0\\), consumer 1’s benefit \\(B(h^{*}) = h^{*}(4-h^{*})\\) is maximized.\n\nWhen \\(h < 2\\), consumer 1 has incentive to increase \\(h\\), as the marginal benefit of \\(h\\) is positive.\nWhen \\(h > 2\\), consumer 1 has incentive to decrease \\(h\\), as the marginal benefit of \\(h\\) is negative.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSuppose now that the government intervenes in the situation by imposing a tax on \\(h\\).\n\nHere is what happens with the tax revenue:\n\nGovernment forces consumer 1 to pay a per-unit tax \\(t\\) on \\(h\\), and to distribute the tax revenue \\(th\\) in some “lump-sum” fashion across both consumers, giving \\(L_{1}\\) to consumer 1 and \\(L_{2}\\) to consumer 2.\n\nDerive the optimal level of the tax—the level that will induce consumer 1 to choose \\(h^{o}\\) rather than \\(h^{*}\\).\n\nAssume that the government anticipates consumer 1’s response to the tax.\n\n\nAnswer:\nWhen designing an optimal tax scheme to maximize the social welfare, government should anticipate how consumers would respond to tax. This consumer’s behavior is characterized by the first-order conditions in consumers’ utility maximization problems. To derive the optimal level of the tax, we therefore should consider each consumer’s maximization problem before determining the optimal tax.\n\nGiven tax \\(t\\) and lump-sum windfall \\(L_{1}\\), consumer 1 solves problem (C-1-cons-t) subject to budget constraint (BC-1-t):\n\\[\n\\begin{align}\n\\max_{x_{1}, h} \\;&U_{1} = x_{1} + h(4-h) \\tag{C-1-cons-t}\\\\\n\\text{subject to} \\quad &Y_{1} + L_{1} = x_{1} + th \\tag{BC-1-t}\n\\end{align}\n\\]\nSubstituting \\(x_{1}\\) in the \\(U_{1}\\) using (BC-1-t) gives:\n\\[\n\\begin{align}\n\\max_{h} \\;U_{1} &= Y_{1} + L_{1} - th + h(4-h) \\tag{C-1-uncons-t}\n\\end{align}\n\\]\nFirst-order condition for problem (C-1-uncons-t) is\n\\[\n\\frac{d U_{1}}{d h} = 4 - 2h - t = 0\\tag{FOC-C-1-h-t}\n\\] Therefore, \\(h^{**} = 2 - \\frac{t}{2}\\) and \\(x_{1}^{**} = Y_{1} + L_{1} - t(2 - \\frac{t}{2})\\).\n\nGiven lump-sum windfall \\(L_{2}\\), consumer 2 solves problem (C-2-cons-t) subject to budget constraint (BC-2-t):\n\\[\n\\begin{align}\n\\max_{x_{2}} \\;&U_{2} =  x_{2} - h^{2} \\tag{C-2-cons-t}\\\\\n\\text{subject to}\\quad &Y_{2} + L_{2} = x_{2} \\tag{BC-2-t}\n\\end{align}\n\\]\nSubstituting \\(x_{2}\\) in the \\(U_{2}\\) using (BC-2-t) gives \\(x_{2}^{**} = Y_{2} + L_{2}\\)\n\nTaking into account how consumer 1 and consumer 2 behave, government solves problem (G-t) subject to government’s budget constraint (BC-G-t):\n\\[\n\\begin{align}\n\\max_{x_{1}, x_{2}, h, t, L_{1}, L_{2}} \\;&SW = x_{1} + x_{2} + h(4-h) - h^{2}\\tag{G-t}\\\\\n\\text{subject to}\\quad &Y_{1} + L_{1} = x_{1} + t h\\tag{BC-1-t}\\\\\n&Y_{2} + L_{2} = x_{2} \\tag{BC-2-t}\\\\\n&L_{1} + L_{2} = th \\tag{BC-G-t}\\\\\n&\\!\\!\\!\\!\\!\\!4 - 2h - t = 0\\tag{FOC-C-1-h-t}\n\\end{align}\n\\] Substituting in (BC-1-t) and (BC-2-t) to eliminate \\(x_{1}\\) and \\(x_{2}\\) simplifies the problem (G-t) to\n\\[\n\\begin{align}\n\\max_{h, t, L_{1}, L_{2}} \\;&SW = Y_{1} + Y_{2} + L_{1} + L_{2} - th\\\\&\\qquad\\quad + h(4-h) - h^{2}\\tag{G-t-v2}\\\\\n\\text{subject to}\\quad &L_{1} + L_{2} = th \\tag{BC-G-t}\\\\\n&\\!\\!\\!\\!\\!\\!4 - 2h - t = 0\\tag{FOC-C-1-h-t}\n\\end{align}\n\\]\nSubstituting in (BC-G-t) to eliminate \\(L_{1}\\) and \\(L_{2}\\) simplifies the problem (G-t-v2) to\n\\[\n\\begin{align}\n\\max_{h, t} \\;&SW = Y_{1} + Y_{2} + h(4-h) - h^{2}\\tag{G-t-v3}\\\\\n\\text{subject to}\\quad &4 - 2h - t = 0\\tag{FOC-C-1-h-t}\n\\end{align}\n\\]\nLagrangian function for problem (G-t-v3) is\n\\[\n\\mathcal{L} = Y_{1} + Y_{2} + h(4-h) - h^{2} -\\lambda(4 - 2h - t)\\tag{G-t-L}\n\\] first-order conditions for problem (G-t-L) are\n\\[\n\\begin{align}\n\\frac{d \\mathcal{L}}{d h} &= h - 4h = 0 \\tag{FOC-G-h}\\\\\n\\frac{d \\mathcal{L}}{d t} &= \\lambda = 0 \\tag{FOC-G-t}\\\\\n\\frac{d \\mathcal{L}}{d \\lambda} &= 4 - 2h - t = 0 \\tag{FOC-G-$\\lambda$}\\\\\n\\end{align}\n\\]\nTherefore, \\(t^{**} = 2\\) and \\(h^{**} = 1 = h^{o}\\). Accordingly, \\(x_{1}^{**} = Y_{1} + L_{1} - 2\\) and \\(x_{2}^{**} = Y_{2} + L_{2}\\).\n\n\nModify both your graphs from question Q1b to show the effects of the tax.\n\nAnswer:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAt \\(h = h^{**} = 1 = h^{o}\\), where \\(MB(h^{**}) - t^{**}h^{**} = 0\\), consumer 1’s benefit with tax payment \\(B(h^{*}) = h^{*}(4-h^{*}) - t^{**}h^{**}\\) is maximized.\n\nWhen \\(h < 1\\), consumer 1 has incentive to increase \\(h\\), as the marginal benefit of \\(h\\) is positive.\nWhen \\(h > 1\\), consumer 1 has incentive to decrease \\(h\\), as the marginal benefit of \\(h\\) is negative.\n\n\n\nAn optimal tax imposed to correct for a negative externality is commonly referred to as a “Pigovian” tax, after the English economist Arthur Pigou (1877-1959). Another common phrase used in this context is that the tax forces consumer 1 to “internalize” the externality she imposes on consumer 2.\n\n\n\n\nSame question as Q1c, but now the government introduces a per-unit subsidy \\(s\\) paid to consumer 1 for every unit by which she reduces \\(h\\) below some level, for example, her optimal level \\(h^{*}\\) without government intervention.\n\nHere is how the government prepares the budget for the total amount of subsidy:\n\nGovernment forces consumers 1 and 2 to pay some amount of “lump-sum” taxes, \\(L_{1}\\) paid by consumer 1 and \\(L_{2}\\) paid by consumer 2, so that the subsidy can be given to consumer 1.\n\nDerive the optimal level of the per-unit subsidy \\(s^{o}\\)—the level that will induce consumer 1 to choose \\(h^{o}\\) rather than \\(h^{*}\\).\n\nAssume that the government anticipates consumer 1’s response to the per-unit subsidy \\(s\\).\n\n\nAnswer:\nConsumer 1 solves problem (C-1-cons-s) subject to budget constraint (BC-1-s):\n\\[\n\\begin{align}\n\\max_{x_{1}, h} \\;&U_{1} = x_{1} + h(4-h) \\tag{C-1-cons-s}\\\\\n\\text{subject to} \\quad &Y_{1} + s(h^{*} - h) - L_{1} = x_{1} \\tag{BC-1-s}\n\\end{align}\n\\]\nSubstituting \\(x_{1}\\) in the \\(U_{1}\\) using (BC-1-s) gives:\n\\[\n\\begin{align}\n\\max_{h} \\;U_{1} &= Y_{1} - L_{1} + s(h^{*} - h) + h(4-h) \\tag{C-1-uncons-s}\n\\end{align}\n\\]\nfirst-order condition for problem (C-1-uncons-s) is\n\\[\n\\frac{d U_{1}}{d h} = 4 - 2h - s = 0\\tag{FOC-C-1-h-s}\n\\] Therefore, \\(h^{***} = 2 - \\frac{s}{2}\\) and \\(x_{1}^{***} = Y_{1} - L_{1} + s(h^{*} - 2 + \\frac{s}{2})\\).\n\nConsumer 2 solves problem (C-2-cons-s) subject to budget constraint (BC-2-s):\n\\[\n\\begin{align}\n\\max_{x_{2}} \\;&U_{2} =  x_{2} - h^{2} \\tag{C-2-cons-s}\\\\\n\\text{subject to}\\quad &Y_{2} - L_{2} = x_{2} \\tag{BC-2-s}\n\\end{align}\n\\]\nSubstituting \\(x_{2}\\) in the \\(U_{2}\\) using (BC-2-s) gives \\(x_{2}^{***} = Y_{2} - L_{2}\\)\nTaking into account how consumer 1 and consumer 2 behave, government solves problem (G-s)\n\\[\n\\begin{align}\n\\max_{x_{1}, x_{2}, h, s, L_{1}, L_{2}} \\;&SW = x_{1} + x_{2} + h(4-h) - h^{2}\\tag{G-t}\\\\\n\\text{subject to}\\quad &Y_{1} - L_{1} + s(h^{*} - h) = x_{1}\\tag{BC-1-s}\\\\\n&Y_{2} - L_{2} = x_{2} \\tag{BC-2-s}\\\\\n&L_{1} + L_{2} = s(h^{*} - h) \\tag{BC-G-s}\\\\\n&\\!\\!\\!\\!\\!\\!4 - 2h - s = 0\\tag{FOC-C-1-h-s}\n\\end{align}\n\\] Substituting in (BC-1-s) and (BC-2-s) to eliminate \\(x_{1}\\) and \\(x_{2}\\) simplifies the problem (G-s) to\n\\[\n\\begin{align}\n\\max_{h, s, L_{1}, L_{2}} \\;&SW = Y_{1} + Y_{2} - L_{1} - L_{2} + s(h^{*} - h)\\\\&\\qquad\\quad  + h(4-h) - h^{2}\\tag{G-s-v2}\\\\\n\\text{subject to}\\quad &L_{1} + L_{2} = s(h^{*} - h) \\tag{BC-G-s}\\\\\n&\\!\\!\\!\\!\\!\\!4 - 2h - s = 0\\tag{FOC-C-1-h-s}\n\\end{align}\n\\] Substituting in (BC-G-s) to eliminate \\(L_{1}\\) and \\(L_{2}\\) simplifies the problem (G-s-v2) to\n\\[\n\\begin{align}\n\\max_{h, t} \\;&SW = Y_{1} + Y_{2} + h(4-h) - h^{2}\\tag{G-s-v3}\\\\\n\\text{subject to}\\quad &4 - 2h - s = 0\\tag{FOC-C-1-h-s}\n\\end{align}\n\\]\nProblem (G-s-v3) is equivalent to (G-t-v3).

Thus the revenue that the cow generates for the villager will be \\(f(c + 1)/(c + 1)\\). He must compare this revenue to the cost of the cow, \\(a\\). If \\(f(c + 1)/(c + 1) > a\\), it is profitable to add the cow since the value of the output exceeds the cost. Hence the villagers will choose to graze cows until the average product of a cow is driven to \\(a\\).\nThat is, if it is profitable to graze a cow on the common field, villagers will purchase cows. They will stop adding cows to the common only when the profits have been driven to zero, that is, when\n\\[\nf(\\hat{c}) - a\\hat{c} = 0.\n\\]\nWhen an individual decides whether or not to purchase a cow, he looks at the extra value he will get \\(f(c)/c\\) and compares this to the cost of the cow, \\(a\\). This is fine for him, but what has been left out of this calculation is the fact that his extra cow will reduce the output of milk from all the other cows. Since he is ignoring this social cost of his purchase, too many cows will be grazed on the common ground."

Our aim is to examine how governance qualities in developing countries impact financial contributions from contributor countries that intend to fund mitigation projects in the energy sector. We have compiled a dataset of yearly climate finance contributions at the project level spanning from 2011 to 2019. Our analysis, which utilizes random forests and LASSO estimations, reveals that climate finance contributions, particularly those for energy-related projects, are significantly linked to good governance, including a robust legal system, rule of law, and accountability. Ultimately, this study provides valuable insights into the dynamics between governance and climate finance in developing countries and informs policy decisions to support effective climate action in the energy sector.

In this article, I estimate the effect of social media campaigns on a congressperson's legislative activities against climate change actions during the U.S. Congresses (January 2013-January 2019). I find that (1) a 1% increase in the per-capita level of activities of climate change campaigns using Twitter decreases Democrats' tendency to support climate-unfriendly legislation by 0.9%, while it increases Republicans' one by 0.2%; and (2) a 1% increase in the fossil fuel industry's lobbying expenditure relative to the rest of industries' lobbying expenditure increases Republicans' tendency to support climate-unfriendly legislation by 1.1%. I also find that negative sentiment in social media campaigns contributes to affecting congresspersons' support for climate-unfriendly legislation. \n  \n  \n     \n    Climate Finance under Conflicts and Renegotiations: A Dynamic Contract Approach  (AEA 2019 poster)     Abstract : Considering climate funds (e.g. the Green Climate Fund) as the financial mechanism to provide funding to developing countries, this paper examines a long-term climate funding relationship between two agents---the rich country and the poor country. Conflicts between the rich and poor countries arise when determining 1) the size of climate funding that the rich country contributes to the poor country, and 2) the funding allocation between climate adaptation and mitigation projects in the poor country. In addition, the rich country cannot be forced to commit contractual contributions to the poor country, and the climate funding relationship can be repeatedly renegotiated. This paper derives the following results: (1) climate funds converge to the first-best in the long-run, in terms of the size of climate funding and its balance between adaptation and mitigation projects, if and only if climate damage becomes sufficiently severe. (2) funding allocation between adaptation and mitigation projects becomes more favorable to the poor country if marginal climate costs in the poor country grow faster than in the rich country. (3) fewer conflicts and fewer renegotiations between the rich and poor countries make climate funding contracts more efficient, remedying inequality between the poor and rich countries."

In other words, even though a giver will never meet the corresponding receiver, he cares enough about how he could be perceived by others to lie (i.e., second-order beliefs enters his utility function). In our experiment we provide givers with the opportunity to lie about the size of the endowment without using their giving. Similar to Ockenfels and Werner (2012) we find that (i) few take the opportunity to lie---but those who do give less when their giving is not constrained by its role as a signal---and (ii) givers are more likely to lie when the lie is private. However, using a second stage in the experimental design, we show that liars are the most responsive group of givers to a simple message stating the expectation of the receiver."
