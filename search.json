They can contribute nothing, everything, or anything in between.\nMultiplication: The total amount in the public pot is multiplied by a factor (e.g., 1.5).\nDistribution: The multiplied amount is then equally distributed among all players, irrespective of their individual contributions.\n\n\n\n\nLet’s consider a simple example with four players, each initially endowed with $10. They have to decide how much to contribute to a public pot.\n\nPlayer A contributes $8\nPlayer B contributes $6\nPlayer C contributes $0 (free-rider)\nPlayer D contributes $4\n\nThe total amount in the public pot is (8 + 6 + 0 + 4 = $18).\nThis amount is then multiplied by a factor, say 1.5, resulting in (18 = $27).\nFinally, the $27 is distributed equally among the four players, giving each (27 / 4 = $6.75).\n\n\n\n\nPlayer A: Started with $10, contributed $8, received $6.75. Final amount: (10 - 8 + 6.75 = $8.75)\nPlayer B: Started with $10, contributed $6, received $6.75. Final amount: (10 - 6 + 6.75 = $10.75)\nPlayer C: Started with $10, contributed $0, received $6.75. Final amount: (10 - 0 + 6.75 = $16.75) (benefited most by free-riding)\nPlayer D: Started with $10, contributed $4, received $6.75. Final amount: (10 - 4 + 6.75 = $12.75)\n\n\n\n\n\nFree-Rider Problem: Players like C who contribute nothing still receive a share of the public good, illustrating the free-rider problem.\nIncentive to Defect: Rational, self-interested players have an incentive to contribute nothing and free-ride on the contributions of others.\nCollective Action Problem: If everyone acts in their self-interest, the public good is under-provided, leading to suboptimal outcomes for the group.\nCooperation and Norms: In many real-world experiments, some level of contribution is observed, indicating that factors like altruism, social norms, or the prospect of future interactions can promote cooperation.\n\nThe Public Goods Game is a powerful tool for studying the complexities of cooperation and the provision of public goods, offering insights into how and why people contribute to collective endeavors."

Set up the Lagrangian: \\[\n\\mathcal{L} = \\alpha\\log x_{1} + \\beta\\log x_{2} + \\lambda(Y - p_{1}x_{1} - p_{2}x_{2}). \\tag{5}\n\\] Differentiate (5) with respect to each of the choice variables, \\(x_{1}, x_{2}\\), and \\(\\lambda\\) to get the three first-order conditions:\n\\[\n\\begin{align}\n\\frac{\\partial\\mathcal{L}}{\\partial x_{1}} &= \\frac{\\alpha}{x_{1}} - \\lambda p_{1} = 0, \\tag{6}\\\\\n\\frac{\\partial\\mathcal{L}}{\\partial x_{2}} &= \\frac{\\beta}{x_{2}} - \\lambda p_{2} = 0, \\tag{7}\\\\\n\\frac{\\partial\\mathcal{L}}{\\partial x_{1}} &= Y - p_{1}x_{1} - p_{2}x_{2} = 0. \\tag{8}\\\\\n\\end{align}\n\\] Now we are to solve the system of equations—three unknowns (\\(x_{1}, x_{2}\\), and \\(\\lambda\\)), three equations (6), (7), and (8).\nRearranging (6) and (7) gives: \\[\n\\begin{align}\nx_{1} = \\frac{\\alpha}{\\lambda p_{1}},\\tag{8}\\\\\nx_{2} = \\frac{\\beta}{\\lambda p_{2}}.\\tag{9}\n\\end{align}\n\\]\nNow we need to find \\(\\lambda\\).\nRearranging (6) and (7) also gives: \\[\n\\begin{align}\n\\alpha  &= \\lambda p_{1}x_{1},\\\\\n\\beta  &= \\lambda p_{2}x_{2}.\n\\end{align}\n\\] Adding the equations above gives:\n\\[\n\\alpha + \\beta = \\lambda(p_{1}x_{1} + p_{2}x_{2}) = \\lambda Y,\n\\] which gives us\n\\[\n\\lambda = \\frac{\\alpha + \\beta}{Y}.\\tag{10}\n\\]\nSubstitute (10) back into (8) and (9) and solve for \\(x_{1}\\) and \\(x_{2}\\) to get\n\\[\n\\begin{align}\nx_{1}^{*} = \\frac{\\alpha}{\\alpha + \\beta} \\frac{Y}{p_{1}},\\\\\nx_{2}^{*} = \\frac{\\beta}{\\alpha + \\beta} \\frac{Y}{p_{2}},\n\\end{align}\n\\]\njust as before."

    "text": "Recently, the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency issued regulations covering the design and construction of landfills for municipal solid waste. Landfills can represent a threat to environmental health if toxic chemicals leach from the waste into surrounding ground or surface waters. \nThe regulations require certain design, construction and maintenance standards extending beyond the post-closure period, including, in most cases, installation of impermeable liners and covers and groundwater monitoring. The purpose of the regulations was to ensure safe containment of solid waste and to prevent future generations from having to bear clean-up costs from poorly-disposed waste. \nEven with the new regulations, just under 10% of landfills will still pose what the EPA considers to be a “moderate” health risk for individuals who depend on contaminated groundwater: a greater than 1 in 1,000,000 increase in the risk of contracting cancer. However, because so few people actually depend on ground water within leaching distance of a landfill, the new regulations were predicted to reduce cancer by only 2 or 3 cases over the next 300 years. Potential benefits of the regulation not quantified by the EPA include: increased ease of siting landfills, reduced damage to surface water, fairness to future generations and an overall reduction in waste generation and related “upstream” pollution encouraged by higher disposal costs. \nIn aggregate, the regulations are expensive: about $5.8 billion, or around $2 billion per cancer case reduced. On a per household basis, this works out to an annual cost of $4.10 in increased garbage bills over the twenty-year life of a landfill. \n\n\nUsing the concept of social welfare represented respectively by equations (1) and (3),\n\\[\n\\begin{align}\nSW &= U_{1}\\left(\\, X_{1},\\, P_{1} \\,\\right) \\,+\\, U_{2}\\left(\\, X_{2},\\, P_{2} \\,\\right) \\,+\\, \\cdots\\quad &(1)\\\\\nSW &= U_{1}\\left(\\, X_{1},\\, w\\times P_{1} \\,\\right) \\,+\\, U_{2}\\left(\\, X_{2},\\, P_{2} \\,\\right) \\,+\\, \\cdots\\quad &(3)\n\\end{align}\n\\] explain why the EPA’s landfill regulation is (a) too strict and (b) not strict enough."

Our aim is to examine how governance qualities in developing countries impact financial contributions from contributor countries that intend to fund mitigation projects in the energy sector. We have compiled a dataset of yearly climate finance contributions at the project level spanning from 2011 to 2019. Our analysis, which utilizes random forests and LASSO estimations, reveals that climate finance contributions, particularly those for energy-related projects, are significantly linked to good governance, including a robust legal system, rule of law, and accountability. Ultimately, this study provides valuable insights into the dynamics between governance and climate finance in developing countries and informs policy decisions to support effective climate action in the energy sector. (One of the chapters in the book, \"Climate Finance: Supporting a Sustainable Energy Transition,\" Springer Nature. 2024). \n  \n  \n     \n    Social Media Campaigns, Lobbying and Legislation: Evidence from #climatechange/#globalwarming and Energy Lobbies    Abstract : To what extent do social media campaigns compete with fossil fuel lobbying on climate change legislation? In this article, I estimate the effect of social media campaigns on a congressperson's legislative activities against climate change actions during the U.S. Congresses (January 2013-January 2019). I find that (1) a 1% increase in the per-capita level of activities of climate change campaigns using Twitter decreases Democrats' tendency to support climate-unfriendly legislation by 0.9%, while it increases Republicans' one by 0.2%; and (2) a 1% increase in the fossil fuel industry's lobbying expenditure relative to the rest of industries' lobbying expenditure increases Republicans' tendency to support climate-unfriendly legislation by 1.1%. I also find that negative sentiment in social media campaigns contributes to affecting congresspersons' support for climate-unfriendly legislation. \n  \n  \n     \n    Climate Finance under Conflicts and Renegotiations: A Dynamic Contract Approach  (AEA 2019 poster)     Abstract : Considering climate funds (e.g. the Green Climate Fund) as the financial mechanism to provide funding to developing countries, this paper examines a long-term climate funding relationship between two agents---the rich country and the poor country. Conflicts between the rich and poor countries arise when determining 1) the size of climate funding that the rich country contributes to the poor country, and 2) the funding allocation between climate adaptation and mitigation projects in the poor country. In addition, the rich country cannot be forced to commit contractual contributions to the poor country, and the climate funding relationship can be repeatedly renegotiated. This paper derives the following results: (1) climate funds converge to the first-best in the long-run, in terms of the size of climate funding and its balance between adaptation and mitigation projects, if and only if climate damage becomes sufficiently severe. (2) funding allocation between adaptation and mitigation projects becomes more favorable to the poor country if marginal climate costs in the poor country grow faster than in the rich country. (3) fewer conflicts and fewer renegotiations between the rich and poor countries make climate funding contracts more efficient, remedying inequality between the poor and rich countries."

In other words, even though a giver will never meet the corresponding receiver, he cares enough about how he could be perceived by others to lie (i.e., second-order beliefs enters his utility function). In our experiment we provide givers with the opportunity to lie about the size of the endowment without using their giving. Similar to Ockenfels and Werner (2012) we find that (i) few take the opportunity to lie---but those who do give less when their giving is not constrained by its role as a signal---and (ii) givers are more likely to lie when the lie is private. However, using a second stage in the experimental design, we show that liars are the most responsive group of givers to a simple message stating the expectation of the receiver."
