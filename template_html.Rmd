## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.




## Scrollable code blocks


```{css, echo=FALSE}
pre {
  max-height: 300px;
  overflow-y: auto;
}

pre[class] {
  max-height: 100px;
}
```

We have defined some CSS rules to limit the height of
code blocks. Now we can test if these rules work on code
blocks and text output:

```{r}
# pretend that we have a lot of code in this chunk
if (1 + 1 == 2) {
  # of course that is true
  print(mtcars)
  # we just printed a lengthy data set
}
```

Next we add rules for a new class `scroll-100` to limit
the height to 100px, and add the class to the output of
a code chunk via the chunk option `class.output`:

```{css, echo=FALSE}
.scroll-100 {
  max-height: 100px;
  overflow-y: auto;
  background-color: inherit;
}
```

```{r, class.output="scroll-100"}
print(mtcars)
```
